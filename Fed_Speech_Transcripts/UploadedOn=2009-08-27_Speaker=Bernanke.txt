Ben S Bernanke: Reflections on a year of crisis Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's Annual Economic Symposium  Jackson Hole  Wyoming  21 August 2009. By the standards of recent decades  the economic environment at the time of this symposium one year ago was quite challenging. A year after the onset of the current crisis in August 2007  financial markets remained stressed  the economy was slowing  and inflation – driven by a global commodity boom – had risen significantly. What we could not fully appreciate when we last gathered here was that the economic and policy environment was about to become vastly more difficult. In the weeks that followed  several systemically critical financial institutions would either fail or come close to failure  activity in some key financial markets would virtually cease  and the global economy would enter a deep recession. My remarks this morning will focus on the extraordinary financial and economic events of the past year  as well as on the policy responses both in the United States and abroad. One very clear lesson of the past year – no surprise  of course  to any student of economic history  but worth noting nonetheless – is that a full-blown financial crisis can exact an enormous toll in both human and economic terms. A second lesson – once again  familiar to economic historians – is that financial disruptions do not respect borders. The crisis has been global  with no major country having been immune. History is full of examples in which the policy responses to financial crises have been slow and inadequate  often resulting ultimately in greater economic damage and increased fiscal costs. In this episode  by contrast  policymakers in the United States and around the globe responded with speed and force to arrest a rapidly deteriorating and dangerous situation. Looking forward  we must urgently address structural weaknesses in the financial system  in particular in the regulatory framework  to ensure that the enormous costs of the past two years will not be borne again. September-October 2008: the crisis intensifies When we met last year  financial markets and the economy were continuing to suffer the effects of the ongoing crisis. We know now that the National Bureau of Economic Research has determined December 2007 as the beginning of the recession. The U.S. unemployment rate had risen to 5-3/4 percent by July  about 1 percentage point above its level at the beginning of the crisis  and household spending was weakening. Ongoing declines in residential construction and house prices and rising mortgage defaults and foreclosures continued to weigh on the U.S. economy  and forecasts of prospective credit losses at financial institutions both here and abroad continued to increase. Indeed  one of the nation's largest thrift institutions  IndyMac  had recently collapsed under the weight of distressed mortgages  and investors continued to harbor doubts about the condition of the government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  despite the approval by the Congress of open-ended support for the two firms. Notwithstanding these significant concerns  however  there was little to suggest that market participants saw the financial situation as about to take a sharp turn for the worse. For example  although indicators of default risk such as interest rate spreads and quotes on credit default swaps remained well above historical norms  most such measures had declined from earlier peaks  in some cases by substantial amounts. And in early September  when the target for the federal funds rate was 2 percent  investors appeared to see little chance that the federal funds rate would be below 1-3/4 percent six months later. That is  as BIS Review 27/2009 1 of this time last year  market participants evidently believed it improbable that significant additional monetary policy stimulus would be needed in the United States. Nevertheless  shortly after our last convocation  the financial crisis intensified dramatically. Despite the steps that had been taken to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  their condition continued to worsen. In early September  the companies' regulator placed both into conservatorship  and the Treasury used its recently enacted authority to provide the firms with massive financial support. Shortly thereafter  several additional large U.S. financial firms also came under heavy pressure from creditors  counterparties  and customers. The Federal Reserve has consistently maintained the view that the disorderly failure of one or more systemically important institutions in the context of a broader financial crisis could have extremely adverse consequences for both the financial system and the economy. We have therefore spared no effort  within our legal authorities and in appropriate cooperation with other agencies  to avert such a failure. The case of the investment bank Lehman Brothers proved exceptionally difficult  however. Concerted government attempts to find a buyer for the company or to develop an industry solution proved unavailing  and the company's available collateral fell well short of the amount needed to secure a Federal Reserve loan of sufficient size to meet its funding needs. As the Federal Reserve cannot make an unsecured loan  and as the government as a whole lacked appropriate resolution authority or the ability to inject capital  the firm's failure was  unfortunately  unavoidable. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury were compelled to focus instead on mitigating the fallout from the failure  for example  by taking measures to stabilize the triparty repurchase (repo) market. In contrast  in the case of the insurance company American International Group (AIG)  the Federal Reserve judged that the company's financial and business assets were adequate to secure an $85 billion line of credit  enough to avert its imminent failure. Because AIG was counterparty to many of the world's largest financial firms  a significant borrower in the commercial paper market and other public debt markets  and a provider of insurance products to tens of millions of customers  its abrupt collapse likely would have intensified the crisis substantially further  at a time when the U.S. authorities had not yet obtained the necessary fiscal resources to deal with a massive systemic event. The failure of Lehman Brothers and the near-failure of AIG were dramatic but hardly isolated events. Many prominent firms struggled to survive as confidence plummeted. The investment bank Merrill Lynch  under pressure in the wake of Lehman's failure  agreed to be acquired by Bank of America; the major thrift institution Washington Mutual was resolved by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in an assisted transaction; and the large commercial bank Wachovia  after experiencing severe liquidity outflows  agreed to be sold. The two largest remaining free-standing investment banks  Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs  were stabilized when the Federal Reserve approved  on an emergency basis  their applications to become bank holding companies. Nor were the extraordinary pressures on financial firms during September and early October confined to the United States: For example  on September 18  the U.K. mortgage lender HBOS  with assets of more than $1 trillion  was forced to merge with Lloyds TSB. On September 29  the governments of Belgium  Luxembourg  and the Netherlands effectively nationalized Fortis  a banking and insurance firm that had assets of around $1 trillion. The same day  German authorities provided assistance to Hypo Real Estate  a large commercial real estate lender  and the British government nationalized another mortgage lender  Bradford and Bingley. On the next day  September 30  the governments of Belgium  France  and Luxembourg injected capital into Dexia  a bank with assets of more than $700 billion  and the Irish government guaranteed the deposits and most other liabilities of six large Irish financial institutions. Soon thereafter  the Icelandic government  lacking the resources to rescue the three largest banks in that country  put them into receivership and requested assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and from other Nordic governments. 2 BIS Review 27/2009 In mid-October  the Swiss authorities announced a rescue package for UBS  one of the world's largest banks  that consisted of a capital injection and a purchase of assets.1 The growing pressures were not limited to banks with significant exposure to U.S. or U.K real estate or to securitized assets. For example  unsubstantiated rumors circulated in late September that some large Swedish banks were having trouble rolling over wholesale deposits  and on October 13 the Swedish government announced measures to guarantee bank debt and to inject capital into banks.2 The rapidly worsening crisis soon spread beyond financial institutions into the money and capital markets more generally. As a result of losses on Lehman's commercial paper  a prominent money market mutual fund announced on September 16 that it had "broken the buck" – that is  its net asset value had fallen below $1 per share. Over the subsequent several weeks  investors withdrew more than $400 billion from so-called prime money funds.3 Conditions in short-term funding markets  including the interbank market and the commercial paper market  deteriorated sharply. Equity prices fell precipitously  and credit risk spreads jumped. The crisis also began to affect countries that had thus far escaped its worst effects. Notably  financial markets in emerging market economies were whipsawed as a flight from risk led capital inflows to those countries to swing abruptly to outflows. The policy response Authorities in the United States and around the globe moved quickly to respond to this new phase of the crisis  although the details differed according to the character of financial systems. The financial system of the United States gives a much greater role to financial markets and to nonbank financial institutions than is the case in most other nations  which rely primarily on banks.4 Thus  in the United States  a wider variety of policy measures was needed than in some other nations. In the United States  the Federal Reserve established new liquidity facilities with the goal of restoring basic functioning in various critical markets. Notably  on September 19  the Fed announced the creation of a facility aimed at stabilizing money market mutual funds  and the Treasury unveiled a temporary insurance program for those funds. On October 7  the Fed announced the creation of a backstop commercial paper facility  which stood ready to lend against highly rated commercial paper for a term of three months.5 Together  these steps 1 Of course  these interventions were not the first of the crisis. For example  in July and August of 2007  two German banks that had relied heavily on market funding through asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits – IKB and Sachsen LB – received assistance from public-sector owners to cope with severe funding pressures. In September 2007  Northern Rock  a large mortgage lender that relied heavily on securitizations for funding  was nationalized by U.K. authorities after experiencing a run by retail depositors. In February 2008  West LB – another German bank with large ABCP conduits – received protection against losses from its owners  including the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. And in March 2008  the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve facilitated the acquisition of the investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. 2 Throughout these remarks  where examples are given  they represent only a selection of instances  not an exhaustive list of all the relevant cases. 3 Prime money funds hold a variety of instruments  with commercial paper and bank obligations typically accounting for the majority of their assets. 4 For example  most financing of automobile purchases was provided through nonbank channels  and such channels began shutting down in September and October of 2008. 5 More precisely  in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)  the Fed lends to a special purpose vehicle that  in turn  purchases highly rated three-month commercial paper directly from eligible issuers. On October 21  the Fed also announced the creation of the Money Market Investor Funding Facility  or MMIFF  which was intended to provide a source of backup liquidity to U.S. money market mutual funds and certain other money market investors. Given the improvement in short-term markets brought about by the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)  the CPFF  and the Treasury guarantee of money market funds  the MMIFF never had to be tapped. Nonetheless  market participants BIS Review 27/2009 3 helped stem the massive outflows from the money market mutual funds and stabilize the commercial paper market. During this period  foreign commercial banks were a source of heavy demand for U.S. dollar funding  thereby putting additional strain on global bank funding markets  including U.S. markets  and further squeezing credit availability in the United States. To address this problem  the Federal Reserve expanded the temporary swap lines that had been established earlier with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank  and established new temporary swap lines with seven other central banks in September and five more in late October  including four in emerging market economies.6 In further coordinated action  on October 8  the Federal Reserve and five other major central banks simultaneously cut their policy rates by 50 basis points. The failure of Lehman Brothers demonstrated that liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve would not be sufficient to stop the crisis; substantial fiscal resources were necessary. On October 3  on the recommendation of the Administration and with the strong support of the Federal Reserve  the Congress approved the creation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program  or TARP  with a maximum authorization of $700 billion to support the stabilization of the U.S. financial system. Markets remained highly volatile and pressure on financial institutions intense through the first weeks of October. On October 10  in what would prove to be a watershed in the global policy response  the Group of Seven (G-7) finance ministers and central bank governors  meeting in Washington  committed in a joint statement to work together to stabilize the global financial system. In particular  they agreed to prevent the failure of systemically important financial institutions; to ensure that financial institutions had adequate access to funding and capital  including public capital if necessary; and to put in place deposit insurance and other guarantees to restore the confidence of depositors.7 In the following days  many countries around the world announced comprehensive rescue plans for their banking systems that built on the G-7 principles. To stabilize funding  during October more than 20 countries expanded their deposit insurance programs  and many also guaranteed nondeposit liabilities of banks. In addition  amid mounting concerns about the solvency of the global banking system  by the end of October more than a dozen countries had announced plans to inject public capital into banks  and several announced plans to purchase or guarantee bank assets. The comprehensive U.S. response  announced on October 14  included capital injections into both large and small banks by the Treasury; a program which allowed banks and bank holding companies  for a fee  to issue FDIC-guaranteed senior debt; the extension of deposit insurance to all noninterest-bearing transactions deposits  of any size; and the Federal Reserve's continued commitment to provide liquidity as necessary to stabilize key financial institutions and markets.8 This strong and unprecedented international policy response proved broadly effective. Critically  it averted the imminent collapse of the global financial system  an outcome that seemed all too possible to the finance ministers and central bankers that gathered in reported that the facility's existence helped reassure investors that ample liquidity would be available in case of further disruptions in the money markets. 6 A crucial feature of these lines is that the Federal Reserve's counterparties are the foreign central banks  which are governmental entities  not the private-sector entities to which those central banks might lend in turn. Accordingly  the Fed bears little risk through these arrangements. 7 Notably  these commitments were reaffirmed on October 11 in communiqués issued by the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the Board of Governors of the IMF and by the Group of Twenty finance ministers and central bank governors. 8 The FDIC's guarantee program complemented a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit  from $100 000 to $250 000 per account  passed by the Congress as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act  the bill that created the TARP. 4 BIS Review 27/2009 Washington on October 10. However  although the intensity of the crisis moderated and the risk of systemic collapse declined in the wake of the policy response  financial conditions remained highly stressed. For example  although short-term funding spreads in global markets began to turn down in October  they remained elevated into this year. And  although generalized pressures on financial institutions subsided somewhat  government actions to prevent the disorderly failures of individual  systemically significant institutions continued to be necessary. In the United States  support packages were announced for Citigroup in November and Bank of America in January. Broadly similar support packages were also announced for some large European institutions  including firms in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.9 Although concerted policy actions avoided much worse outcomes  the financial shocks of September and October nevertheless severely damaged the global economy – starkly illustrating the potential effects of financial stress on real economic activity. In the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this year  global economic activity recorded its weakest performance in decades. In the United States  real GDP plummeted at nearly a 6 percent average annual pace over those two quarters – an even sharper decline than had occurred in the 1981-82 recession. Economic activity contracted even more precipitously in many foreign economies  with real GDP dropping at double-digit annual rates in some cases. The crisis affected economic activity not only by pushing down asset prices and tightening credit conditions  but also by shattering household and business confidence around the world. In response to these developments  the Federal Reserve expended the remaining ammunition in the traditional arsenal of monetary policy  bringing the federal funds rate down  in steps  to a target range of 0 to 25 basis points by mid-December of last year. It also took several measures to further supplement its traditional arsenal. In particular  on November 25  the Fed announced that it would purchase up to $100 billion of debt issued by the housing-related GSEs and up to $500 billion of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities  programs that were expanded substantially and augmented by a program of purchases of Treasury securities in March.10 The goal of these purchases was to provide additional support to private credit markets  particularly the mortgage market. Also on November 25  the Fed announced the creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). This facility aims to improve the availability and affordability of credit for households and small businesses and to help facilitate the financing and refinancing of commercial real estate properties. The TALF has shown early success in reducing risk spreads and stimulating new securitization activity for assets included in the program. Foreign central banks also cut policy rates implemented unconventional monetary measures. For example  the Bank of Japan began purchasing commercial paper in December and corporate bonds in January. In March  the Bank of England announced that it would purchase government securities  commercial paper  and corporate bonds  and the Swiss National Bank announced that it would purchase corporate bonds and foreign currency. For its part  the ECB injected more than €400 billion of one-year funds in a single auction in late June. In July  the ECB began purchasing covered bonds  which are bonds that are issued by financial institutions and guaranteed by specific asset levels and to very low 9 On January 26  the Dutch government announced that it would provide ING Group  a large banking and insurance firm  with loss protection on some of its assets  following up a €10 billion capital injection on October 19. Shortly afterward  the U.K. Treasury announced packages for the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and for Lloyds Banking Group that included loss protection on assets and  in the case of RBS  a capital injection. 10 In March  the Federal Reserve announced that it would purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and raised the caps on other purchases to $200 billion for the direct debt of the housing-related GSEs and $1.25 trillion for agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities. BIS Review 27/2009 5 pools. Actions by central banks augmented large fiscal stimulus packages in the United States  China  and a number of other countries. On February 10  Treasury Secretary Geithner and the heads of the federal banking agencies unveiled the outlines of a new strategy for ensuring that banking institutions could continue to provide credit to households and businesses during the financial crisis. A central component of that strategy was the exercise that came to be known as the bank stress test.11 Under this initiative  the banking regulatory agencies undertook a forward-looking  simultaneous evaluation of the capital positions of 19 of the largest bank holding companies in the United States  with the Treasury committing to provide public capital as needed. The goal of this supervisory assessment was to ensure that the equity capital held by these firms was sufficient – in both quantity and quality – to allow those institutions to withstand a worse-than- expected macroeconomic environment over the subsequent two years and yet remain healthy and capable of lending to creditworthy borrowers. This exercise  unprecedented in scale and scope  was led by the Federal Reserve in cooperation with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. Importantly  the agencies' report made public considerable information on the projected losses and revenues of the 19 firms  allowing private analysts to judge for themselves the credibility of the exercise. Financial market participants responded favorably to the announcement of the results  and many of the tested banks were subsequently able to tap public capital markets. Overall  the policy actions implemented in recent months have helped stabilize a number of key financial markets  both in the United States and abroad. Short-term funding markets are functioning more normally  corporate bond issuance has been strong  and activity in some previously moribund securitization markets has picked up. Stock prices have partially recovered  and U.S. mortgage rates have declined markedly since last fall. Critically  fears of financial collapse have receded substantially. After contracting sharply over the past year  economic activity appears to be leveling out  both in the United States and abroad  and the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good. Notwithstanding this noteworthy progress  critical challenges remain: Strains persist in many financial markets across the globe  financial institutions face significant additional losses  and many businesses and households continue to experience considerable difficulty gaining access to credit. Because of these and other factors  the economic recovery is likely to be relatively slow at first  with unemployment declining only gradually from high levels. Interpreting the crisis: elements of a classic panic How should we interpret the extraordinary events of the past year  particularly the sharp intensification of the financial crisis in September and October? Certainly  fundamentals played a critical role in triggering those events. As I noted earlier  the economy was already in recession  and it had weakened further over the summer. The continuing dramatic decline in house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious concerns about the values of mortgage-related assets  and thus about large potential losses at financial institutions. More broadly  investors remained distrustful of virtually all forms of private credit  especially structured credit products and other complex or opaque instruments. At the same time  however  the events of September and October also exhibited some features of a classic panic  of the type described by Bagehot and many others.12 A panic is a generalized run by providers of short-term funding to a set of financial institutions  possibly resulting in the failure of one or more of those institutions. The historically most familiar type 11 Officially  it was called the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  or SCAP. 12 See Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897)  Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons). 6 BIS Review 27/2009 of panic  which involves runs on banks by retail depositors  has been made largely obsolete by deposit insurance or guarantees and the associated government supervision of banks.13 But a panic is possible in any situation in which longer-term  illiquid assets are financed by short-term  liquid liabilities  and in which suppliers of short-term funding either lose confidence in the borrower or become worried that other short-term lenders may lose confidence.14 15 Although  in a certain sense  a panic may be collectively irrational  it may be entirely rational at the individual level  as each market participant has a strong incentive to be among the first to the exit. Panics arose in multiple contexts last year. For example  many financial institutions  notably including the independent investment banks  financed a portion of their assets through short- term repo agreements. In repo agreements  the asset being financed serves as collateral for the loan  and the maximum amount of the loan is the current assessed value of the collateral less a haircut. In a crisis  haircuts typically rise as short-term lenders attempt to protect themselves from possible declines in asset prices. But this individually rational behavior can set off a run-like dynamic: As high haircuts make financing portfolios more difficult  some borrowers may have no option but to sell assets into illiquid markets. These forced sales drive down asset prices  increase volatility  and weaken the financial positions of all holders of similar assets  which in turn increases the risks borne by repo lenders and thus the haircuts they demand.16 This unstable dynamic was apparent around the time of the near- failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008  and haircuts rose particularly sharply during the worsening of the crisis in mid-September.17 As we saw last fall  when a vicious funding spiral of this sort is at work  falling asset prices and the collapse of lender confidence may create financial contagion  even between firms without significant counterparty relationships. In such an environment  the line between insolvency and illiquidity may be quite blurry. 13 The Northern Rock episode in the United Kingdom may be seen as a counterexample  but in that case deposit insurance coverage was only partial. 14 To be sure  there are good economic reasons for a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities in the financial system  including allowing households flexibility in when to consume (see Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983)  "Bank Runs  Deposit Insurance  and Liquidity " Journal of Political Economy  vol. 91 (June)  pp. 401-19). Moreover  short-term creditors can help to impose market discipline on financial institutions (see Charles W. Calomiris and Charles M. Kahn (1991)  "The Role of Demandable Debt in Structuring Optimal Banking Arrangements " American Economic Review  vol. 81 (June)  pp. 497-513; and Douglas W. Diamond and Raghuram G. Rajan (2001)  "Liquidity Risk  Liquidity Creation  and Financial Fragility: A Theory of Banking " Journal of Political Economy  vol. 109 (April)  pp. 287-327). 15 Also  during a panic  financial firms concerned about funding are likely to hoard liquidity  further exacerbating the situation. See Douglas W. Diamond and Raghuram G. Rajan (2009)  "Fear of Fire Sales and the Credit Freeze " NBER Working Paper Series 14925 (Cambridge  Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research  April); and Zhiguo He and Wei Xiong (2009)  "Dynamic Debt Runs) " unpublished paper  June 30  Princeton University  Princeton  N.J. 16 See Markus K. Brunnermeier (2009)  "Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008 " Journal of Economic Perspectives  vol. 23 (Winter)  pp. 77-100. This dynamic differed from the standard bank run in that investors did not completely withdraw funding. The reason for the difference lies in the nature of the lending contract. In a standard bank deposit contract  the price of deposits in terms of currency is fixed  and so depositors have no alternative to withdrawal when the value of deposits falls below the value of currency. For similar reasons  many investors in money market mutual funds withdrew all their funds when the redemption value exceeded the value of holding the fund. In contrast  in the case of repo lending  lenders have the alternative to withdrawal of varying the haircut they demand. There is a close analogy to the discounting of bank notes during the U.S. free banking era  as discussed by Gorton (see Gary Gorton (1996)  "Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets " Journal of Political Economy  vol. 104 (April)  pp. 346-97). In either case  however  variations in the liquidity premium play an important role in the amount of funding that lenders are willing to provide against a given set of assets. 17 See Gary B. Gorton and Andrew Metrick (2009)  "Securitized Banking and the Run on Repo " Yale International Center for Finance Working Paper No. 14  July. BIS Review 27/2009 7 Panic-like phenomena occurred in other contexts as well. Structured investment vehicles and other asset-backed programs that relied heavily on the commercial paper market began to have difficulty rolling over their short-term funding very early in the crisis  forcing them to look to bank sponsors for liquidity or to sell assets.18 Following the Lehman collapse  panic gripped the money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market  as I have discussed. More generally  during the crisis runs of uninsured creditors have created severe funding problems for a number of financial firms. In some cases  runs by creditors were augmented by other types of "runs" – for example  by prime brokerage customers of investment banks concerned about the funds they held in margin accounts. Overall  the role played by panic helps to explain the remarkably sharp and sudden intensification of the financial crisis last fall  its rapid global spread  and the fact that the abrupt deterioration in financial conditions was largely unforecasted by standard market indicators. The view that the financial crisis had elements of a classic panic  particularly during its most intense phases  has helped to motivate a number of the Federal Reserve's policy actions.19 Bagehot instructed central banks – the only institutions that have the power to increase the aggregate liquidity in the system – to respond to panics by lending freely against sound collateral.20 Following that advice  from the beginning of the crisis the Fed (like other central banks) has provided large amounts of short-term liquidity to financial institutions. As I have discussed  it also provided backstop liquidity support for money market mutual funds and the commercial paper market and added significant liquidity to the system through purchases of longer-term securities. To be sure  the provision of liquidity alone can by no means solve the problems of credit risk and credi
