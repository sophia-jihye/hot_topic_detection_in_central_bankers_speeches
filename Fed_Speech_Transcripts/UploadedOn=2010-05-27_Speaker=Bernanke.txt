Ben S Bernanke: Central bank independence  transparency  and accountability Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies International Conference  Bank of Japan  Tokyo  25 May 2010. The original speech  which contains various links to the documents mentioned  can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. The financial crisis that began nearly three years ago has caused great hardship for people in many parts of the world and represented the most profound challenge to central banks since the Great Depression. Faced with unprecedented financial stresses and sharp contractions in economic activity  many central banks  including the Federal Reserve  responded with extraordinary measures. In the United States  we lowered the federal funds rate target to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent to help mitigate the economic downturn; we expanded the scale  scope  and maturity of our lending to provide needed liquidity to financial institutions and to address dislocations in financial markets; we jointly established currency swap lines with foreign central banks (including the Bank of Japan) to ensure the global availability of dollar funding; and we purchased a large quantity of longer-term securities to help improve the functioning of financial markets and support economic recovery.1 Looking to the future  central banks around the world are working with their governments to prevent future crises by strengthening frameworks for financial regulation and supervision. In undertaking financial reforms  it is important that we maintain and protect the aspects of central banking that proved to be strengths during the crisis and that will remain essential to the future stability and prosperity of the global economy. Chief among these aspects has been the ability of central banks to make monetary policy decisions based on what is good for the economy in the longer run  independent of short-term political considerations. Central bankers must be fully accountable to the public for their decisions  but both theory and experience strongly support the proposition that insulating monetary policy from short-term political pressures helps foster desirable macroeconomic outcomes and financial stability. In my remarks today  I will outline the general case for central bank independence and review the evolution of the independence of the Federal Reserve and other major central banks. I will also discuss the requirements of transparency and accountability that must accompany this independence. The case for central bank independence A broad consensus has emerged among policymakers  academics  and other informed observers around the world that the goals of monetary policy should be established by the political authorities  but that the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit of those goals should be free from political control.2 This conclusion is a consequence of the time frames over 1 The currency swap lines were reinstated with several foreign central banks recently in response to financial disruptions associated with stresses in Europe. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010)  “Federal Reserve  European Central Bank  Bank of Canada  Bank of England  and Swiss National Bank Announce Re-establishment of Temporary U.S. Dollar Liquidity Swap Facilities ” press release  May 9; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010)  “FOMC Authorizes Re-establishment of Temporary U.S. Dollar Liquidity Swap Arrangement with the Bank of Japan ” press release  May 10. 2 A useful distinction is that between “goal independence” and “instrument independence.” Goal independence for central banks – the freedom of the central bank to set its own goals – is difficult to justify in a democratic BIS Review 72/2010 1 which monetary policy has its effects. To achieve both price stability and maximum sustainable employment  monetary policymakers must attempt to guide the economy over time toward a growth rate consistent with the expansion in its underlying productive capacity. Because monetary policy works with lags that can be substantial  achieving this objective requires that monetary policymakers take a longer-term perspective when making their decisions. Policymakers in an independent central bank  with a mandate to achieve the best possible economic outcomes in the longer term  are best able to take such a perspective. In contrast  policymakers in a central bank subject to short-term political influence may face pressures to overstimulate the economy to achieve short-term output and employment gains that exceed the economy’s underlying potential. Such gains may be popular at first  and thus helpful in an election campaign  but they are not sustainable and soon evaporate  leaving behind only inflationary pressures that worsen the economy’s longer-term prospects. Thus  political interference in monetary policy can generate undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy and higher inflation. Undue political influence on monetary policy decisions can also impair the inflation-fighting credibility of the central bank  resulting in higher average inflation and  consequently  a less- productive economy. Central banks regularly commit to maintain low inflation in the longer term; if such a promise is viewed as credible by the public  then it will tend to be self-fulfilling  as inflation expectations will be low and households and firms will temper their demands for higher wages and prices. However  a central bank subject to short-term political influences would likely not be credible when it promised low inflation  as the public would recognize the risk that monetary policymakers could be pressured to pursue short-run expansionary policies that would be inconsistent with long-run price stability. When the central bank is not credible  the public will expect high inflation and  accordingly  demand more-rapid increases in nominal wages and in prices. Thus  lack of independence of the central bank can lead to higher inflation and inflation expectations in the longer run  with no offsetting benefits in terms of greater output or employment.3 Additionally  in some situations  a government that controls the central bank may face a strong temptation to abuse the central bank’s money-printing powers to help finance its budget deficit. Nearly two centuries ago  the economist David Ricardo argued: “It is said that Government could not be safely entrusted with the power of issuing paper money; that it would most certainly abuse it.…There would  I confess  be great danger of this  if Government – that is to say  the ministers – were themselves to be entrusted with the power of issuing paper money.”4 Abuse by the government of the power to issue money as a means of financing its spending inevitably leads to high inflation and interest rates and a volatile economy. These concerns about the effects of political interference on monetary policy are far from being purely theoretical  having been validated by the experiences of central banks around the world and throughout history. In particular  careful empirical studies support the view that more-independent central banks tend to deliver better inflation outcomes than less- independent central banks  without compromising economic growth.5 In light of all these considerations  it is no mystery why so many observers have come to see central bank society  but  as I will argue today  instrument independence – the ability of the central bank to determine the appropriate settings of monetary policy without interference – is vital for economic stability. 3 This problem is known in the technical literature as the “time-inconsistency” problem; this literature was pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (1978). This problem is analyzed in the context of monetary policy by Barro and Gordon (1983). 4 Ricardo (1824  p. 506). 5 See  among others  Alesina (1988); Grilli  Masciandaro  and Tabellini (1991); Cukierman (1992); Cukierman  Webb  and Neyapti (1992); Alesina and Summers (1993); Cukierman  Kalaitzidakis  Summers  and Webb (1993); and Cukierman  Miller  and Neyapti (2002). 2 BIS Review 72/2010 independence as a critical component of a sound macroeconomic framework  and economists have studied a variety of approaches to enhance the independence and credibility of monetary policymakers.6 To be clear  I am by no means advocating unconditional independence for central banks. First  for its policy independence to be democratically legitimate  the central bank must be accountable to the public for its actions. As I have already mentioned  the goals of policy should be set by the government  not by the central bank itself; and the central bank must regularly demonstrate that it is appropriately pursuing its mandated goals. Demonstrating its fidelity to its mandate in turn requires that the central bank be transparent about its economic outlook and policy strategy  as I will discuss further in a moment. Second  the independence afforded central banks for the making of monetary policy should not be presumed to extend without qualification to its nonmonetary functions. For example  many central banks  including the Federal Reserve  have significant responsibilities for oversight of the banking system. To be effective  bank regulators and supervisors also require an appropriate degree of independence; in particular  the public must be confident that regulators’ decisions about the soundness of specific institutions are not unduly influenced by political pressures or lobbying. But for a number of reasons  the nature and scope of the independence granted regulatory agencies is likely to be somewhat different than that afforded monetary policy. In the conduct of its regulatory and supervisory activities  the central bank should enjoy a degree of independence that is no greater and no less than that of other agencies engaged in the same activities; there should be no “spillover” from monetary policy independence to independence in other spheres of activity. In practice  the Federal Reserve engages cooperatively with other agencies of the U.S. government on a wide range of financial and supervisory issues without compromising the independence of monetary policy. The case for independence also requires clarity about the range of central bank activities deemed to fall under the heading of monetary policy. Conventional monetary policy  which involves setting targets for short-term interest rates or the growth rates of monetary aggregates  clearly qualifies. I would also include under the heading of monetary policy the central bank’s discount-window and lender-of-last-resort activities. These activities involve the provision of short-term  fully collateralized loans to the financial system as a means of meeting temporary liquidity needs  reducing market dysfunctions  or calming financial panics. As has been demonstrated during financial panics for literally hundreds of years  the ability of central banks to independently undertake such lending allows for a more rapid and effective response in a crisis. On the other hand  as fiscal decisions are the province of the executive and the legislature  the case for independent lender-of-last-resort authority is strongest when the associated fiscal risks are minimal. Requiring that central bank lending be fully secured  as is the case in the United States  helps to limit its fiscal implications. Looking forward  the Federal Reserve supports measures that help further clarify the dividing line between monetary and fiscal responsibilities. Notably  the development of a new statutory framework for the resolution of failing  systemically important firms is not only highly desirable as a means of reducing systemic risk  but it will also be useful in establishing the appropriate roles of the Federal Reserve and other agencies in such resolutions. The issue of the fiscal-monetary distinction may also arise in the case of the nonconventional policy known as quantitative easing  in which the central bank provides additional support for the economy and the financial system by expanding the monetary base  for example  through the purchase of long-term securities. Rarely employed outside of Japan before the crisis  central banks in a number of advanced economies have undertaken variants of quantitative easing in recent years as conventional policies have reached their limits. In the 6 Rogoff (1985) suggested the appointment of a central banker predisposed toward keeping inflation low and stable as a solution to the time-inconsistency problem; additional discussions are presented in Persson and Tabellini (1993) and Walsh (2003  chapter 8). Alesina and Gatti (1995) and Waller and Walsh (1996) address how establishing an independent  nonpartisan central bank can help insulate monetary policy from political pressures. BIS Review 72/2010 3 United States  the Federal Reserve has purchased both Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises. Although quantitative easing  like conventional monetary policy  works by affecting broad financial conditions  it can have fiscal side effects: increased income  or seigniorage  for the government when longer-term securities are purchased  and possible capital gains or losses when securities are sold. Nevertheless  I think there is a good case for granting the central bank independence in making quantitative easing decisions  just as with other monetary policies. Because the effects of quantitative easing on growth and inflation are qualitatively similar to those of more conventional monetary policies  the same concerns about the potentially adverse effects of short-term political influence on these decisions apply. Indeed  the costs of undue government influence on the central bank’s quantitative easing decisions could be especially large  since such influence might be tantamount to giving the government the ability to demand the monetization of its debt  an outcome that should be avoided at all costs. The historical evolution of central bank independence Support for the idea of central bank independence has evolved over time. In the United States and many other countries  the historically high and volatile inflation rates in the 1970s and early 1980s prompted a reexamination of monetary policies and central bank practices. Since that time  we have observed the confluence of two global trends: the widespread adoption of improved monetary policy practices and the virtual elimination of high inflation rates. The improved policy practices prominently include a broad strengthening of central bank independence  increased transparency on the part of monetary policy committees  and the affirmation of price stability as a mandated goal for monetary policy. Inflation targeting  in which the government sets a numerical target for inflation but assigns responsibility for achieving that target to the central bank  has become a widely used framework embodying these principles  but other similar monetary frameworks have also proved effective. In recent years  the number of central banks with a relatively high degree of independence has steadily increased  and the experience of some major central banks testifies to the importance of that independence. The Bank of England  one of the oldest central banks in the world  was essentially an agent of the British Treasury for a substantial part of the 20th century. When the government announced on May 6  1997  that the Bank of England would be reborn as an independent central bank  U.K. Treasury bond yields fell sharply at longer maturities  likely reflecting a substantial decline in investors’ inflation expectations and their perceptions of inflation risk. Moreover  several studies have shown that U.K. inflation expectations exhibited significantly greater stability in the years following independence.7 Prior to the creation of the European Central Bank (ECB) in June1998  independence was seen as such a crucial element that it was enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty  an international agreement that can only be changed by unanimous consent of its signatories. The independence of the ECB has helped to keep euro-area inflation expectations firmly anchored.8 The importance of central bank independence also motivated a 1997 revision to Japanese law that gave the Bank of Japan operational independence.9 This revision significantly 7 See  for instance  Castelnuovo  Altimari  and Rodriguez-Palenzuela (2003); and Gürkaynak  Levin  and Swanson (2006). 8 Beechey  Johannsen  and Levin (2008) find that long-run inflation expectations in the euro area are not significantly affected by surprises in macroeconomic data releases  suggesting that those expectations are well anchored. 9 The new Bank of Japan Act went into effect on April 1  1998. 4 BIS Review 72/2010 diminished the scope for the Ministry of Finance to influence central bank decisions  thus strengthening the Bank of Japan’s autonomy in setting monetary policy. Although the Federal Reserve was established as an independent central bank in 1913  its effective degree of independence has gradually increased over time. Initially  the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency sat on the Board; they were removed when the current structure of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was introduced with the Banking Act of 1935. The act also extended the terms of Board members from 10 years to 14 years; the long  staggered terms of Board members have also served as a brake on political influence. During World War II  the Federal Reserve agreed to peg Treasury yields at low levels to reduce the cost of financing wartime deficits. After the war  the Fed sought to resume an independent monetary policy  fearing the inflationary consequences of continued political control  but the Treasury was still intent on containing the cost of servicing the debt. The conflict was resolved in 1951 through the negotiation of the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord  as it came to be known. The accord reestablished the Federal Reserve’s ability to freely set interest rates  but with active consultation between the Fed and Treasury. It was only by the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 that the Fed’s current objectives of maximum employment and stable prices were specified by the Congress.10 A clear mandate of this kind is a key pillar of central bank independence. Over the years  a consensus developed among U.S. political leaders that the Federal Reserve’s independence in making monetary policy is critical to the nation’s prosperity and economic stability. In 1978  the Congress formally recognized this principle by approving a provision that exempts monetary policy  discount window operations  and the Fed’s interactions with other central banks from Government Accountability Office policy reviews. In 1979  President Carter appointed Paul Volcker chairman of the Federal Reserve with the expectation that Volcker would strengthen the central bank’s inflation-fighting credibility  even though involve short-term economic and political costs. Subsequently  President Reagan’s support for Volcker’s politically unpopular disinflationary policies and for the principle of Federal Reserve independence proved crucial to the ultimate victory over inflation  a victory that set the stage for sustained growth.11 Presidents and other U.S. political leaders have since then regularly testified to the benefits of an independent Federal Reserve. For instance  President Clinton said in 2000  “[O]ne of the hallmarks of our economic strategy has been a respect for the independence and the integrity of the Federal Reserve.”12 President Bush noted in 2005  “It’s this independence of the Fed that gives people not only here in America[ ] but the world  confidence.”13 And President Obama said in August 2009  “We will continue to maintain a strong and independent Federal Reserve.”14 those steps would likely 10 The Employment Act of 1946 established the objectives of “maximum employment  production  and purchasing power” for all federal agencies  whereas the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act gave the Federal Reserve the specific mandate of promoting “maximum employment  stable prices  and moderate long-term interest rates.” Price stability requires that the central bank not attempt to drive employment above its sustainable level  and so in practice the Federal Reserve has interpreted its mandate to include maximum sustainable employment. The goal of moderate long-term interest rates is frequently dropped from statements of the Federal Reserve’s mandate not because the goal is unimportant  but because moderate long-term interest rates are generally the by-product of price stability. 11 For example  in February 1982  President Reagan stated: “This administration will always support the political independence of the Federal Reserve Board.” See Reagan (1982). 12 See Clinton (2000). 13 See Bush (2005). 14 See Obama (2009). BIS Review 72/2010 5 Transparency and accountability Central bank independence is essential  but  as I have noted  it cannot be unconditional. Democratic principles demand that  as an agent of the government  a central bank must be accountable in the pursuit of its mandated goals  responsive to the public and its elected representatives  and transparent in its policies. Transparency regarding monetary policy in particular not only helps make central banks more accountable  it also increases the effectiveness of policy. Clarity about the aims of future policy and about how the central bank likely would react under various economic circumstances reduces uncertainty and – by helping households and firms anticipate central bank actions – amplifies the effect of monetary policy on longer-term interest rates. The greater clarity and reduced uncertainty  in turn  increase the ability of policymakers to influence economic growth and inflation.15 Over the years  the Federal Reserve – like many central banks around the world – has taken significant steps to improve its transparency and accountability. Policymakers give frequent speeches and testimonies before the Congress on the economic situation and on the prospects for policy  and the Federal Reserve submits an extensive report to the Congress twice each year on the economy and monetary policy.16 The FOMC  the Fed’s monetary policymaking arm  releases a statement after each of its meetings that explains the Committee’s policy decision and reports the vote on that decision. The FOMC also publishes the minutes of each meeting just three weeks after the meeting occurs and provides  with a lag  full meeting transcripts. In addition  the FOMC has begun providing the public a quarterly summary of Committee participants’ forecasts of key economic variables and  more recently  their assessments of the longer-run values to which these variables would be expected to converge over time.17 The information released by the FOMC provides substantial grist for the activities of legions of “Fed watchers” who analyze all aspects of monetary policy in great detail. Apart from traditional monetary policy  the Federal Reserve’s response to the financial crisis has involved a range of new policy measures  about which the Fed has provided extensive information. For example  the Board has regularly published detailed information about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the special liquidity facilities that were introduced. We created a section on our website devoted to these issues and initiated a regular monthly report as well.18 And we are committed to exploring new ways to enhance the Federal Reserve’s transparency without compromising our mandated monetary policy and financial stability objectives.19 Conclusion As a result of the crisis  countries around the world are implementing significant financial and regulatory reforms. Such reforms that reduce the chance of a future crisis and that mitigate the effects of any crisis that does occur are worthy of our full support. As we move along the path of reform  however  it is crucial that we maintain the ability of central banks to make monetary policy independently of short-term political influence. In exchange for this independence  central banks must meet transparency and accountability. At the Federal Reserve  we will continue to work to facilitate public their responsibilities for 15 See Woodford (2005). 16 See Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. 17 See Bernanke (2007) for a discussion. 18 For further information on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet  see Bernanke (2009) and “Credit and Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet.” 19 See  for example  Bernanke (2007) and Alvarez (2009). 6 BIS Review 72/2010 understanding of both our monetary policy decisions and our actions to ensure the soundness of the financial system.
