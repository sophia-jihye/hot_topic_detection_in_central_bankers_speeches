  Janet L Yellen: Labor market dynamics and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Ms  Janet  L  Yellen,  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, 
Wyoming, 22 August 2014. 
 In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made considerable 
progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United 
States since the Great Depression.1 More jobs have now been created in the recovery than 
were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the 
previous peak in January 2008. Job gains in 2014 have averaged 230,000 a month, up from 
the  190,000  a  month  pace  during  the  preceding  two  years.  The  unemployment  rate,  at 
6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage points from its late 2009 peak. Over the 
past year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace. 
These  developments  are  encouraging,  but  it  speaks  to  the  depth  of  the  damage  that, five 
years after the end of the recession, the labor market has yet to fully recover. 
The  Federal  Reserve’s  monetary  policy  objective  is  to  foster  maximum  employment  and 
price  stability.  In  this  regard,  a  key  challenge  is  to  assess  just  how  far  the  economy  now 
stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal. Judgments concerning the size 
of  that gap  are  complicated  by  ongoing  shifts  in  the  structure  of  the  labor  market  and  the 
possibility  that  the  severe  recession  caused  persistent  changes  in  the  labor  market’s 
functioning. 
These  and  other  questions  about  the  labor  market  are  central  to  the  conduct  of  monetary 
policy,  so  I  am  pleased  that  the  organizers  of  this  year’s  symposium  chose  labor  market 
dynamics as its theme. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I 
look to the presentations and discussions over the next two days for insights into possible 
changes  that  are  affecting  the  labor  market.  I  expect,  however,  that  our  understanding  of 
labor market developments and their potential implications for inflation will remain far from 
perfect.  As  a  consequence,  monetary  policy  ultimately  must  be  conducted  in  a  pragmatic 
manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing 
assessment of a wide range of information in the context of our ever-evolving understanding 
of the economy. 
The labor market recovery and monetary policy 
In my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments related to the functioning 
of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the remaining degree of slack. 
Differing interpretations of these developments affect judgments concerning the appropriate 
path  of  monetary  policy.  Before  turning  to  the  specifics,  however,  I  would  like  to  provide 
some  context  concerning the  role  of the  labor market  in  shaping monetary  policy  over  the 
past  several  years.  During  that  time,  the  FOMC  has  maintained  a  highly  accommodative 
monetary  policy  in  pursuit  of  its  congressionally  mandated goals  of maximum  employment 
and stable prices. The Committee judged such a stance appropriate because inflation has 
fallen short of our 2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far 
from any reasonable definition of maximum employment. 
The FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment rate stood 
at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired. The 
                                                
1  Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010, compared 
with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948–49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s.

  Committee’s objective was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor 
market,  and  as  progress  toward  this  goal  has  materialized,  we  have  reduced  our  pace  of 
asset purchases and expect to complete this program in October. In addition, in December 
2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, stating that “as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two 
years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 
2  percent  longer-run  goal,  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations  continue  to  be  well 
anchored”, the Committee would not even consider raising the federal funds rate above the 
0 to  1/4  percent  range.2 This “threshold  based” forward  guidance  was  deemed  appropriate 
under conditions in which inflation was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously 
far from maximum employment. 
Earlier  this  year,  however,  with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  faster  than  had  been 
anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the FOMC recast its forward guidance, 
stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for 
the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress – both realized and expected – 
toward  its  objectives  of  maximum  employment  and  2  percent  inflation.”3  As  the  recovery 
progresses,  assessments  of  the  degree  of  remaining  slack  in  the  labor  market  need  to 
become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about the level of employment 
consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Indeed, in its 2012 statement on longer-
run  goals  and  monetary  policy  strategy,  the  FOMC  explicitly  recognized  that  factors 
determining  maximum  employment  “may  change  over  time  and  may  not  be  directly 
measurable”,  and that  assessments  of  the  level  of  maximum  employment  “are  necessarily 
uncertain and subject to revision.”4 Accordingly, the reformulated forward guidance reaffirms 
the  FOMC’s  view  that  policy  decisions  will  not  be  based  on  any  single  indicator,  but  will 
instead take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, as well as inflation 
and financial developments.5  
Interpreting labor market surprises: past and future 
The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially challenging 
recently.  Estimates  of  slack  necessitate  difficult  judgments  about  the  magnitudes  of  the 
cyclical  and  structural  influences  affecting  labor  market  variables,  including  labor  force 
participation,  the  extent  of  part-time  employment  for  economic  reasons,  and  labor  market 
flows, such as the pace of hires and quits. A considerable body of research suggests that the 
behavior of these and other labor market variables has changed since the Great Recession.6 
Along  with  cyclical  influences,  significant  structural  factors  have  affected  the  labor  market,

5  The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent abroad. 
Last  year  the  Bank  of  England  announced  its  intention  not  to  raise  its  policy  rate  at  least  until  the 
unemployment rate reached 7 percent, subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability. Since that time, 
the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly, prompting policymakers to 
consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in the U.K. economy. 
As  in  the  United  States,  an  unexpectedly  swift  decline  in  unemployment  has  raised  questions  about  the 
structural and cyclical effects of a severe recession.  
6  For  a  discussion  of  important  differences  in  the  evolution  of  labor  market  conditions  during  the  Great 
Recession relative to typical postwar patterns, see Henry S. Farber (2011), “Job Loss in the Great Recession: 
Historical Perspective from the Displaced Workers Survey, 1984–2010”, NBER Working Paper Series 17040 
(Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, May).

  including the aging of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the 
underlying degree of dynamism in the labor market, and the phenomenon of “polarization” – 
that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle-skill jobs.7  
Consider  first  the  behavior  of  the  labor  force  participation  rate,  which  has  declined 
substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen. As a 
consequence,  the  employment-to-population  ratio  has  increased  far  less  over  the  past 
several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past experience. 
For policymakers, the key question is: What portion of the decline in labor force participation 
reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical  weakness in the labor market? If 
the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the unemployment rate, then it might 
be seen as an additional contributor to labor market slack. 
Labor force  participation  peaked  in  early  2000,  so  its  decline  began  well  before  the  Great 
Recession. A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby boom generation. 
But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession. As an accounting matter, the drop in 
the  participation  rate  since  2008  can  be  attributed  to  increases  in  four  factors:  retirement, 
disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 Of these, 
greater  worker  discouragement  is  most  directly  the  result  of  a  weak  labor  market,  so  we 
could  reasonably  expect  further  increases  in  labor  demand  to  pull  a  sizable  share  of 
discouraged  workers  back  into  the  workforce.  Indeed,  the  flattening  out  of  the  labor  force 
participation  rate  since  late  last  year  could  partly  reflect  discouraged  workers rejoining  the 
labor force in response to the significant improvements that we have seen in labor market 
conditions. If so, the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation may have diminished. 
What is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase in disability rates, 
retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects cyclical forces. While 
structural  factors  have  clearly  and  importantly  affected  each  of  these  three  trends,  some 
portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from these trends could be related 
to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might reverse in a stronger labor market.9 
Disability applications and educational enrollments typically are affected by cyclical factors, 
and existing evidence suggests that the elevated levels of both may partly reflect perceptions 
of  poor  job  prospects.10  Moreover,  the  rapid  pace  of  retirements  over  the  past  few  years 
                                                
7  For  convenience,  the  analysis  here  is  presented  as  if  cyclical  factors  and  structural  factors  can  be  neatly 
delineated. In reality, the line between the two may be indistinct. Moreover, what begins as cyclical weakness 
may  evolve  into  structural  damage.  For  a  discussion  of  the  strategic  issues  that  arise  when  policymakers 
believe  such  evolution  from  cyclical  to  structural  to  be  an  important  feature  of  the  economy,  see  Dave

  might reflect some degree of pull-forward of future retirements in the face of a weak labor 
market. If so, retirements might contribute less to declining participation in the period ahead 
than would otherwise be expected based on the aging workforce.11  
A  second  factor  bearing  on  estimates  of  labor  market  slack  is  the  elevated  number  of 
workers who are employed part time but desire full-time work (those classified as “part time 
for economic reasons”). At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of such workers is 
notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical historically, providing 
another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate may understate the amount 
of  remaining  slack  in  the  labor  market.  Again,  however,  some  portion  of  the  rise  in 
involuntary part-time work may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors. For example, the 
ongoing  shift  in  employment  away  from  goods  production  and  toward  services,  a  sector 
which historically has used a greater portion of part-time workers, may be boosting the share 
of part-time jobs. Likewise, the continuing decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could 
be replaced by part-time jobs, may raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12 
Despite  these  challenges  in  assessing  where  the  share  of  those  employed  part  time  for 
economic  reasons  may  settle  in  the  long  run,  the  sharp  run-up  in  involuntary  part-time 
employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors 
are significant. 
Private sector labor market flows provide additional indications of the strength of the labor 
market.  For  example,  the  quits  rate  has  tended  to  be  pro-cyclical,  since  more  workers 
voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to find new ones 
and when firms are competing more actively for new hires. Indeed, the quits rate has picked 
up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it still remains somewhat 
depressed  relative  to  its  level  before  the  recession.  A  significant  increase  in  job  openings 
over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market conditions, but the hiring 
rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the recession. Given the rise in job 
vacancies,  hiring  may  be  poised  to  pick  up,  but  the failure  of  hiring  to  rise  with  vacancies 
could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient 
to  justify  adding  to  payrolls.  Alternatively,  subdued  hiring  could  indicate  that  firms  are 
encountering difficulties in finding qualified job applicants. As is true of the other indicators I 
                                                                                                                                                   
Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles). On the cyclicality of college enrollment, see Andrew Barr 
and Sarah Turner (2013), “Down and Enrolled: An Examination of the Enrollment Response to Cyclical Trends 
and Job Loss (PDF)”, paper presented at the PERC Applied Microeconomics workshop, held at Texas A&M 
University, College Station, Texas, March 20. For research showing that the high numbers of workers seeking 
disability status is correlated with sectoral employment declines and demographics and not correlated with the 
rate of workplace injuries, see Norma B. Coe and Matthew S. Rutledge (2013), “Why Did Disability Allowance 
Rates  Rise  in  the  Great  Recession?  (PDF)”  Center  for  Retirement  Research  paper  13–11  (Chestnut  Hill,

in  Disability  Claims  (PDF)”,  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Richmond,  Region  Focus  (Second/Third  Quarter), 
pp. 24–26. 
11  The  effects  of  the  Great  Recession  on  retirements  are  difficult  to  identify.  During  the  recession  and 
immediately  after,  the  losses  in  wealth  may  have  put  upward  pressure  on  labor  force  participation;  the 
persistently  weak  labor  market  may  have  subsequently  contributed  to  more  retirements  and  thus  put 
downward pressure on participation. Perhaps as a result of these confounding forces, early research on the 
effects  of  the  Great  Recession  on  retirement  finds  unclear  results.  For  example,  see  Alan  L.  Gustman, 
Thomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai (2011), “How Did the Recession of 2007–2009 Affect the Wealth 
and Retirement of the Near Retirement Age Population in the Health and Retirement Study?” NBER Working 
Paper Series 17547 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, October). For a discussion 
of  these  developments,  see  Richard  W.  Johnson  (2012),  “Older  Workers,  Retirement,  and  the  Great

Inequality, October).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  have  discussed,  labor  market  flows  tend  to  reflect  not  only  cyclical  but  also  structural 
changes in the economy. Indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market 
dynamism, which could prove quite persistent.13 That said, the balance of evidence leads me 
to  conclude  that  weak  aggregate  demand  has  contributed  significantly  to  the  depressed 
levels of quits and hires during the recession and in the recovery. 
One convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number of indicators 
is through the use of so-called factor models. Following this methodology, Federal Reserve 
Board  staff  developed  a  labor  market  conditions  index  from  19  labor  market  indicators, 
including four I just discussed.14 This broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the 
labor  market  has  improved  significantly  over  the  past  year,  but  it  also  suggests  that  the 
decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in 
overall labor market conditions. 
Finally,  changes  in  labor  compensation  may  also  help  shed  light  on  the  degree  of  labor 
market slack, although here, too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing between 
cyclical and structural influences. Over the past several years, wage inflation, as measured 
by  several  different  indexes,  has  averaged  about  2  percent,  and  there  has  been  little 
evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation. Indeed, in real 
terms,  wages  have  been  about  flat,  growing  less  than  labor  productivity.  This  pattern  of 
subdued  real  wage  gains  suggests  that  nominal  compensation  could  rise  more  quickly 
without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation. And, since wage movements 
have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both 
nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by 
the current unemployment rate. 
There are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a conclusion. 
First,  the  sluggish  pace  of  nominal  and  real  wage  growth  in  recent  years  may  reflect  the 
phenomenon  of  “pent-up  wage  deflation”.15  The  evidence  suggests  that  many  firms  faced 
significant constraints in lowering compensation during the recession and the earlier part of 
the  recovery  because  of  “downward  nominal  wage  rigidity”  –  namely,  an  inability  or 
unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages. To the extent that firms faced limits 
in  reducing  real  and  nominal  wages  when  the  labor  market  was  exceptionally  weak,  they 
may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract qualified workers. As a result, 
wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market strengthens. If pent-up wage deflation

and destruction, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger (2012), “Labor Market Flows 
in  the  Cross  Section  and  over  Time”,  Journal  of  Monetary  Economics,  vol.  59  (January),  pp.  1–18.  For  a 
review of a range of evidence and possible explanations, see Henry R. Hyatt and James R. Spletzer (2013), 
“The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics (PDF)”, IZA Discussion Paper Series 7231 (Bonn, Germany: 
Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), February). These authors suggest that much additional work is needed 
to understand the role of different factors in changes in labor market dynamism. For an analysis that raises the 
possibility that some of these shifts reflect better job matches, see Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and 
Abigail K. Wozniak (2014), “Declining Migration within the U.S.: The Role of the Labor Market”, NBER Working 
Paper Series 20065 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, April).  
14  Among  the  indicators  in  the  “labor  market  conditions  index”  are  the  labor  force  participation  rate,  workers 
classified  as  part  time  for  economic  reasons,  hires,  and  quits.  The  index  does  not  include  the  JOLTS  job 
openings series but instead uses the Board staff’s composite help-wanted index, which has a longer history; 
the two measures generally track each other closely. See Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick, Christopher Nekarda, 
and  David  Ratner  (2014),  “Assessing  the  Change  in  Labor  Market  Conditions”,  FEDS  Notes  (Washington: 
Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve  System,  May  22).  For  a  closely  related  index  of  labor  market 
conditions, see Craig S. Hakkio and Jonathan L. Willis (2013), “Assessing Labor Market Conditions: The Level

  is holding down wage growth, the current very moderate wage growth could be a misleading 
signal of the degree of remaining slack. Further, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably 
more rapid pace once pent-up wage deflation has been absorbed. 
Second, wage developments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that have likely 
affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years. As I noted, real wages have 
been  rising  less  rapidly  than  productivity,  implying  that  real  unit  labor  costs  have  been 
declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their 
recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure. However, research suggests 
that  the  decline  in  real  unit  labor  costs  may  partly  reflect  secular  factors  that  predate  the 
recession,  including  changing  patterns  of  production  and  international  trade,  as  well  as 
measurement issues.16 If so, productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains 
even when the economy is again operating at its potential. 
A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because 
of  the  dislocations  of  the  Great  Recession,  transitory  wage  and  price  pressures  could 
emerge  well  before  maximum  sustainable  employment  has  been  reached,  although  they 
would  abate  over  time  as  the  economy  moves  back  toward  maximum  employment.17  The 
argument is that workers who have suffered long-term unemployment – along with, perhaps, 
those  who  have  dropped  out  of  the  labor  force  but  would  return  to  work  in  a  stronger 
economy – face significant impediments to reemployment. In this case, further improvement 
in  the  labor  market  could  entail  stronger  wage  pressures  for  a  time  before  maximum 
employment has been attained.18

(2013), “The Decline of the U.S. Labor Share (PDF)”, Working Paper Series 2013–27 (San Francisco: Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, September). The notion that the labor share of income is a good measure of 
slack was prominent in the empirical literature on the New-Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi 
Galí and Mark Gertler (1999), “Inflation Dynamics: A Structural Econometric Analysis”, Journal of Monetary 
Economics, vol. 44 (October), pp. 195–222), and the connections (or lack thereof) between the labor share 
and traditional measures of slack (in the statistical sense) were highlighted in, among others, Michael T. Kiley 
(2007), “A Quantitative Comparison of Sticky-Price and Sticky-Information Models of Price Setting”, Journal of 
Money,  Credit  and  Banking,  vol.  39  (February),  pp.  101–25;  and  Michael  T.  Kiley  (2013),  “Output  Gaps”, 
Journal  of  Macroeconomics,  vol.  37  (September),  pp.  1–18.  Moreover,  recent  research  has  highlighted  the 
challenges that swings in the labor share have presented for the interpretation of inflation developments (for 
example,  Marco  Del  Negro,  Marc  P.  Giannoni,  and  Frank  Schorfheide  (2014),  “Inflation  in  the  Great

The interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part because 
the  strong  trends  in  participation  due  to  demographic  factors  have  implied  that  it  is  difficult  to  identify  the 
cyclical  component.  For  an  important  example  of  a  study  demonstrating,  within  the  core  macroeconomic 
framework widely used in research, that movements in participation should be considered in models of wage 
and price determination, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and

  Implications of labor market developments for monetary policy 
The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and 
how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of 
the  economy  relative  to  the  FOMC’s  objective  of  maximum  employment.  In  my  remaining 
time, I will turn to the special challenges that these difficulties in assessing the labor market 
pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy. 
Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal Reserve’s dual 
mandate  to  promote  maximum  employment  and  price  stability.  For  much  of  the  past  five 
years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and substantial degree of slack in the 
labor  market  and  significant  risks  of  slipping  into  persistent  below-target  inflation.  In  such 
circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is unambiguous, in my view. 
However,  with  the  economy  getting  closer  to  our  objectives,  the  FOMC’s  emphasis  is 
naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how quickly that slack is 
likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what conditions we should begin 
dialing back our extraordinary accommodation. As should be evident from my remarks so far, 
I  believe  that  our  assessments  of  the  degree  of  slack  must  be  based  on  a  wide  range  of 
variables and will require difficult judgments about the cyclical and structural influences in the 
labor market. While these assessments have always been imprecise and subject to revision, 
the task has become especially challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which 
brought  nearly  unprecedented  cyclical  dislocations  and  may  have  been  associated  with 
similarly unprecedented structural changes in the labor market – changes that have yet to be 
fully understood. 
So,  what  is  a  monetary  policymaker  to  do?  Some  have  argued  that,  in  light  of  the 
uncertainties  associated  with  estimating  labor  market  slack,  policymakers  should  focus 
mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy. To take an extreme case, 
if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could largely 
ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to determine the 
extent of slack in the labor market. In present circumstances, with inflation still running below 
the  FOMC’s  2  percent  objective,  such  an  approach  would  suggest  that  we  could  maintain 
policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 percent, at which point 
we could also be confident that slack had diminished. 
Of course, our task is not nearly so straightforward. Historically, slack has accounted for only 
a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation. Indeed, unusual aspects of the current recovery 
may  have  shifted  the  lead-lag  relationship  between  a  tightening  labor  market  and  rising 
inflation  pressures  in  either  direction.  For  example,  as  I  discussed  earlier,  if  downward 
nominal  wage  rigidities  created  a  stock  of  pent-up  wage  deflation  during  the  economic 
downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated with a given amount of slack or 
pace  of  reduction  in  slack  might  be  unusually  low  for  a  time.  If  so,  the  first  clear  signs  of 
inflation  pressure  could  come  later  than  usual  in  the  progression  toward  maximum 
employment. As a result, maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until 
inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, unduly delay the removal of accommodation, 
necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on. 
Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years – such as depressed 
participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial level of long-term 
unemployment – may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than usual as the degree of 
slack in the labor market declines. However, some of the resulting wage and price pressures 
could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and 
lower long-term unemployment.19 As a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as

  inflation  moves  back  toward  2  percent  might,  in  this  case,  prevent  labor  markets  from 
recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate. 
Inferring  the  degree  of  resource  utilization  from  real-time  readings  on  inflation  is  further 
complicated  by  the  familiar  challenge  of  distinguishing  transitory  price  changes  from 
persistent price pressures. Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 2 percent goal 
appears to reflect a combination of both factors. 
These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation pressures in the 
current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be grappling with as 
the recovery continues. There is no simple recipe for appropriate policy in this context, and 
the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly describe the policy framework we are 
using to meet these challenges. As the FOMC has noted in its recent policy statements, the 
stance of policy will be guided by our assessments of how far we are from our objectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of 
progress toward those objectives. 
At  the  FOMC’s  most  recent  meeting,  the  Committee  judged,  based  on  a  range  of  labor 
market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved”.20 Indeed, as I noted earlier, they 
have  improved  more  rapidly  than  the  Committee  had  anticipated.  Nevertheless,  the 
Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains significant. Given this 
assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its 
longer-run  objective,  the  Committee  reaffirmed  its  view  “that  it  likely  will  be  appropriate  to 
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our 
current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 
the  Committee’s  2  percent  longer-run  goal,  and  provided  that  longer-term  inflation 
expectations  remain  well  anchored.”21  But  if  progress  in  the  labor  market  continues  to  be 
more  rapid  than  anticipated  by  the  Committee  or  if  inflation  moves  up  more  rapidly  than 
anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the 
federal funds rate target could come sooner than the Committee currently expects and could 
be more rapid thereafter. Of course, if economic performance turns out to be disappointing 
and progress toward our goals proceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of 
interest rates likely  would be more accommodative than  we currently anticipate. As I have 
noted many times, monetary policy is not on a preset path. The Committee will be closely 
monitoring  incoming  information  on  the  labor  market  and  inflation  in  determining  the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy. 
Overall,  I  suspect  that  many  of  the  labor  market  issues  you  will  be  discussing  at  this 
conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come. I thank you in 
advance for the insights you will offer and encourage you to continue the important research 
that advances our understanding of cyclical and structural labor market issues.
