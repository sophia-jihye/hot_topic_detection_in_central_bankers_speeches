Ben S Bernanke: Regulatory reform Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Financial Services  US House of Representatives  Washington DC  1 October 2009. The original speech  which contains various links to the documents mentioned  can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. Chairman Frank  Ranking Member Bachus  and other members of the Committee  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss ways of improving the financial regulatory framework to better protect against systemic risks. In my view  a broad-based agenda for reform should include at least five key elements. First  legislative change is needed to ensure that systemically important financial firms are subject to effective consolidated supervision  whether or not the firm owns a bank. Second  an oversight council made up of the agencies involved in financial supervision and regulation should be established  with a mandate to monitor and identify emerging risks to financial stability across the entire financial system  to identify regulatory gaps  and to coordinate the agencies' responses to potential systemic risks. To further encourage a more comprehensive and holistic approach to financial oversight  all federal financial supervisors and regulators – not just the Federal Reserve – should be directed and empowered to take account of risks to the broader financial system as part of their normal oversight responsibilities. Third  a new special resolution process should be created that would allow the government to wind down a failing systemically important financial institution whose disorderly collapse would pose substantial risks to the financial system and the broader economy. Importantly  this regime should allow the government to impose losses on shareholders and creditors of the firm. Fourth  all systemically important payment  clearing  and settlement arrangements should be subject to consistent and robust oversight and prudential standards. And fifth  policymakers should ensure that consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive practices in their financial dealings. Taken together  these changes should significantly improve both the regulatory system's ability to constrain the buildup of systemic risks as well as the financial system's resiliency when serious adverse shocks occur. Consolidated supervision of systemically important financial institutions The current financial crisis has clearly demonstrated that risks to the financial system can arise not only in the banking sector  but also from the activities of other financial firms – such as investment banks or insurance companies – that traditionally have not been subject to the type of regulation and consolidated supervision applicable to bank holding companies. To close this important gap in our regulatory structure  legislative action is needed that would subject all systemically for consolidated prudential supervision that currently applies to bank holding companies. Such action would prevent financial firms that do not own a bank  but that nonetheless pose risks to the overall financial system because of the size  risks  or interconnectedness of their financial activities  from avoiding comprehensive supervisory oversight. Besides being supervised on a consolidated basis  systemically important financial institutions should also be subject to enhanced regulation and supervision  including capital  institutions the same framework important financial to BIS Review 119/2009 1 liquidity  and risk-management requirements that reflect those institutions' important roles in the financial sector. Enhanced requirements are needed not only to protect the stability of individual institutions and the financial system as a whole  but also to reduce the incentives for financial firms to become very large in order to be perceived as too big to fail. This perception materially weakens the incentive of creditors of the firm to restrain the firm's risk- taking  and it creates a playing field that is tilted against smaller firms not perceived as having the same degree of government support. Creation of a mechanism for the orderly resolution of systemically important nonbank financial firms  which I will discuss later  is an important additional tool for addressing the too-big-to-fail problem. The Federal Reserve is already the consolidated supervisor of some of the largest and most complex institutions in the world. I believe that the expertise we have developed in supervising large  diversified  and interconnected banking organizations  together with our broad knowledge of the financial markets in which these organizations operate  makes the Federal Reserve well suited to serve as the consolidated supervisor for those systemically important financial institutions that may not already be subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition  our involvement in supervision is critical for ensuring that we have the necessary expertise  information  and authorities to carry out our essential functions as a central bank of promoting financial stability and making effective monetary policy. The Federal Reserve has already taken a number of important steps to improve its regulation and supervision of large financial groups  building on lessons from the current crisis. On the regulatory side  we played a key role in developing the recently announced  internationally- agreed improvements to the capital requirements for trading activities and securitization exposures  and we continue to work with other regulators to strengthen the capital requirements for other types of on- and off-balance-sheet exposures.1 In addition  we are working with our fellow regulatory agencies toward the development of capital standards and other supervisory tools that would be calibrated to the systemic importance of the firm. Options under consideration in this area include requiring systemically important institutions to hold aggregate levels of capital above current regulatory norms or to maintain a greater share of capital in the form of common equity or instruments with similar loss-absorbing attributes  such as "contingent" capital that converts to common equity when necessary to mitigate systemic risk. The financial crisis also highlighted weaknesses in liquidity risk management at major financial institutions  including an overreliance on short-term funding. To address these issues  the Federal Reserve helped lead the development of revised international principles for sound liquidity risk management  which have been incorporated into new interagency guidance now out for public comment.2 In the supervisory arena  the recently completed Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)  popularly known as the stress test  was quite instructive for our efforts to strengthen our prudential oversight of the largest banking organizations.3 This unprecedented 1 See Bank for International Settlements (2009)  "Basel II Capital Framework Enhancements Announced by the Basel Committee " press release  July 13; and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2009)  Enhancements to the Basel II Framework (Basel: Basel Committee  July). 2 See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2008)  Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision (Basel: Basel Committee  September). Information about the proposed guidance is available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Office of Thrift Supervision  and National Credit Union Administration (2009)  "Agencies Seek Comment on Proposed Interagency Guidance on Funding and Liquidity Risk Management " joint press release  June 30. 3 For more information about the SCAP  see Ben S. Bernanke (2009)  "The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program " speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 2009 Financial Markets Conference  held in Jekyll Island  Ga.  May 11. 2 BIS Review 119/2009 interagency process  which was led by the Federal Reserve  incorporated forward-looking  cross-firm  aggregate analyses of 19 of the largest bank holding companies  which together control a majority of the assets and loans within the U.S. banking system. Drawing on the SCAP experience  we have increased our emphasis on horizontal examinations  which focus on particular risks or activities across a group of banking organizations  and we have broadened the scope of the resources we bring to bear on these reviews. We also are in the process of creating an enhanced quantitative surveillance program for large  complex organizations that will use supervisory information  firm-specific data analysis  and market- based indicators to identify emerging risks to specific firms as well as to the industry as a whole. This work will be performed by a multidisciplinary group composed of our economic and market researchers  supervisors  market operations specialists  and other experts within the Federal Reserve System. Periodic scenario analysis will be used to enhance our understanding of the consequences of changes in the economic environment for both individual firms and for the broader system. Finally  to support and complement these initiatives  we are working with the other federal banking agencies to develop more comprehensive information-reporting requirements for the largest firms. Systemic risk oversight For purposes of both effectiveness and accountability  the consolidated supervision of an individual firm  whether or not it is systemically important  is best vested with a single agency. However  the broader task of monitoring and addressing systemic risks that might arise from the interaction of different types of financial institutions and markets – both regulated and unregulated – may exceed the capacity of any individual supervisor. Instead  we should seek to marshal the collective expertise and information of all financial supervisors to identify and respond to developments that threaten the stability of the system as a whole. This objective can be accomplished by modifying the regulatory architecture in two important ways. First  an oversight council – composed of representatives of the agencies and departments involved in the oversight of the financial sector – should be established to monitor and identify emerging systemic risks across the full range of financial institutions and markets. Examples of such potential risks include rising and correlated risk exposures across firms and markets; significant increases in leverage that could result in systemic fragility; and gaps in regulatory coverage that arise in the course of financial change and innovation  including the development of new practices  products  and institutions. A council could also play useful roles in coordinating responses by member agencies to mitigate emerging systemic risks  in recommending actions to reduce procyclicality in regulatory and supervisory practices  and in identifying financial firms that may deserve designation as systemically important. To fulfill its responsibilities  a council would need access to a broad range of information from its member agencies regarding the institutions and markets they supervise and  when the necessary information is not available through that source  the authority to collect such information directly from financial institutions and markets. Second  the Congress should support a reorientation of individual agency mandates to include not only the responsibility to oversee the individual firms or markets within each agency's scope of authority  but also the responsibility to try to identify and respond to the risks those entities may pose  either individually or through their interactions with other firms or markets  to the financial system more broadly. These actions could be taken by financial supervisors on their own initiative or based on a request or recommendation of the oversight council. Importantly  each supervisor's participation in the oversight council would greatly strengthen that supervisor's ability to see and understand emerging risks to financial stability. At the same time  this type of approach would vest the agency that has responsibility and accountability for the relevant firms or markets with the authority for developing and implementing effective and tailored responses to systemic threats arising within their purview. To maximize effectiveness  the oversight council could help coordinate responses when risks cross regulatory boundaries  which often will be the case. BIS Review 119/2009 3 The Federal Reserve already has begun to incorporate a systemically focused approach into our supervision of large  interconnected firms. Doing so requires that we go beyond considering each institution in isolation and pay careful attention to interlinkages and interdependencies among firms and markets that could threaten the financial system in a crisis. For example  the failure of one firm may lead to runs by wholesale funders of other firms that are seen by investors as similarly situated or that have exposures to the failing firm. These efforts are reflected  for example  in the expansion of horizontal reviews and the quantitative surveillance program I discussed earlier. Improved resolution process Another critical element of the systemic risk agenda is the creation of a new regime that would allow the orderly resolution of failing  systemically important financial firms. In most cases  the federal bankruptcy laws provide an appropriate framework for the resolution of nonbank financial institutions. However  the bankruptcy code does not sufficiently protect the public's strong interest in ensuring the orderly resolution of a nonbank financial firm whose failure would pose substantial risks to the financial system and to the economy. Indeed  after the Lehman Brothers and AIG experiences  there is little doubt that we need a third option between the choices of bankruptcy and bailout for such firms. A new resolution regime for nonbanks  analogous to the regime currently used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for banks  would provide the government the tools to restructure or wind down a failing systemically important firm in a way that mitigates the risks to financial stability and the economy and thus protects the public interest. It also would provide the government a mechanism for imposing losses on the shareholders and creditors of the firm. Establishing credible processes for imposing such losses is essential to restoring a meaningful degree of market discipline and addressing the too-big-to-fail problem. The availability of a workable resolution regime also would replace the need for the Federal Reserve to use its emergency lending authority under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to prevent the failure of specific institutions. Payment  clearing  and settlement arrangements Payment  clearing  and settlement arrangements are the foundation of the nation's financial infrastructure. These arrangements include centralized market utilities for clearing and settling payments  securities  and derivatives transactions  as well as the decentralized activities through which financial institutions clear and settle such transactions bilaterally. While these arrangements can create significant efficiencies and promote transparency in the financial markets  they also may concentrate substantial credit  liquidity  and operational risks  and  absent strong risk controls  may themselves be a source of contagion in times of stress. Unfortunately  the current regulatory and supervisory framework for systemically important payment  clearing  and settlement arrangements is fragmented  creating the potential for inconsistent standards to be adopted or applied. Under the current system  no single regulator is able to develop a comprehensive understanding of the interdependencies  risks  and risk-management approaches across the full range of arrangements serving the financial markets today. In light of the increasing integration of global financial markets  it is important that systemically critical payment  clearing  and settlement arrangements be viewed from a systemwide perspective and that they be subject to strong and consistent prudential standards and supervisory oversight. We believe that additional authorities are needed to achieve these goals. 4 BIS Review 119/2009 Consumer protection As the Congress considers financial reform  it is vitally important that consumers be protected from unfair and deceptive practices in their financial dealings. Strong consumer protection helps preserve households' savings  promotes confidence in financial institutions and markets  and adds materially to the strength of the financial system. We have seen in this crisis that flawed or inappropriate financial instruments can lead to bad results for families and for the stability of the financial sector. In addition  the playing field is uneven regarding examination and enforcement of consumer protection laws among banks and nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies on the one hand  and firms not affiliated with banks on the other hand. Addressing this discrepancy is critical both for protecting consumers and for ensuring fair competition in the market for consumer financial products. Conclusion Thank you again for the opportunity to testify on these important matters. The Federal Reserve looks forward to working with the Congress and the Administration to enact meaningful regulatory reform that will strengthen the financial system and reduce both the probability and severity of future crises.
