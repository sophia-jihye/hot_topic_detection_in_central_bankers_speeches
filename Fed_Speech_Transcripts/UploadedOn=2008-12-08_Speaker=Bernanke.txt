Ben S Bernanke: Housing  mortgage markets  and foreclosures Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Federal Reserve System Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets  Washington DC  4 December 2008. The original speech  which contains various links to the documents mentioned  can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. The U.S. financial system has been in turmoil during the past 16 months. Credit conditions have tightened and asset values have declined  contributing substantially  in turn  to the weakening of economic activity. As the participants in this conference are keenly aware  I am sure  housing and housing finance played a central role in precipitating the current crisis. As the crisis has persisted  however  the relationships between housing and other parts of the economy have become more complex. Declining house prices  delinquencies and foreclosures  and strains in mortgage markets are now symptoms as well as causes of our general financial and economic difficulties. These interlinkages imply that policies aimed at improving broad financial and economic conditions and policies focused specifically on housing may be mutually reinforcing. Indeed  the most effective approach very likely will involve a full range of coordinated measures aimed at different aspects of the problem. I will begin this morning with some comments on developments in the housing sector and on the interactions among house prices  mortgage markets  foreclosures  and the broader economy. I will then discuss both some steps taken to date and some additional measures that might be taken to support housing and the economy by reducing the number of avoidable foreclosures. As we as a nation continue to fashion our policy responses in coming weeks and months  we must draw on the best thinking available. I expect that the papers presented at this conference will add significantly to our understanding of these important issues. Developments in housing and housing finance As you know  the current housing crisis is the culmination of a large boom and bust in house prices and residential construction that began earlier in this decade. Home sales and single- family housing starts held unusually steady through the 2001 recession and then rose dramatically over the subsequent four years. National indexes of home prices accelerated significantly over that period  with prices in some metropolitan areas more than doubling over the first half of the decade.1 One unfortunate consequence of the rapid increases in house prices was that providers of mortgage credit came to view their loans as well-secured by the rising values of their collateral and thus paid less attention to borrowers' ability to repay.2 However  no real or financial asset can provide an above-normal market return indefinitely  and houses are no exception. When home-price appreciation began to slow in many areas  the consequences of weak underwriting  such as little or no documentation and low required down payments  became apparent. Delinquency rates for subprime mortgages – especially those with adjustable interest rates – began to climb steeply around the middle of 2006. 1 Estimates for specific metropolitan areas are based on Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes. 2 See Kristopher Gerardi  Andreas Lehnert  Shane Sherlund  and Paul Willen (forthcoming)  "Making Sense of the Subprime Crisis"  Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington: Brookings Institution Press).

BIS Review 152/2008 1 When house prices were rising  higher-risk borrowers who were struggling to make their payments could refinance into more-affordable mortgages. But refinancing became increasingly difficult as many of these households found that they had accumulated little  if any  housing equity. Moreover  lenders tightened standards on higher-risk mortgages as secondary markets for those loans ceased to function. Higher-risk mortgages are not the only part of the mortgage market to have experienced stress. For example  while some lenders continue to originate so-called jumbo prime mortgages and hold them on their own balance sheets  these loans have generally been available only on more restrictive terms and at much higher spreads relative to prime conforming mortgage rates than before the crisis. Mortgage rates in the prime conforming market – although down somewhat from their peaks – remain high relative to yields on longer-term Treasury securities  and lending terms have tightened for this segment as well. As house prices have declined  many borrowers now find themselves "under water" on their mortgages – perhaps as many as 15 to 20 percent by some estimates. In addition  as the economy has slowed and unemployment has risen  more households are finding it difficult to make their mortgage payments. About 4-1/2 percent of all first-lien mortgages are now more than 90 days past due or in foreclosure  and one in ten near-prime mortgages in alt-A pools and more than one in five subprime mortgages are seriously delinquent.3 Lenders appear to be on track to initiate 2-1/4 million foreclosures in 2008  up from an average annual pace of less than 1 million during the pre-crisis period.4 Predictably  home sales and construction have plummeted. Sales of new homes and starts of single-family houses are now running at about one-third of their peak levels in the middle part of this decade. Sales of existing homes  including foreclosure sales  are now about two- thirds of their earlier peak. Notwithstanding the sharp adjustment in construction  inventories of unsold new homes  though down in absolute terms  are close to their record high when measured relative to monthly sales  suggesting that residential construction is likely to remain soft in the near term. As I mentioned earlier  the problems in housing and mortgage markets have become inextricably intertwined with broader financial and economic developments. For example  mortgage-related losses have eroded the capital of many financial institutions  leading them to become more reluctant to make not only mortgage loans  but other types of loans to consumers and businesses as well. Likewise  some homeowners have responded to declining home values by cutting back their spending  and residential construction remains subdued. Thus  weakness in the housing market has proved a serious drag on overall economic activity. A slowing economy has in turn reduced the demand for houses  implying a further weakening of conditions in the mortgage and housing markets. Reducing preventable foreclosures Because developments in the housing sector have become so interlinked with the evolution of the financial markets and the economy as a whole  both macro and micro policies have a role in addressing the strains in housing. At the macro level  the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps  beginning with the easing of monetary policy. To the extent that more accommodative monetary policies make credit conditions easier and incomes higher than they otherwise would have been  they support the housing market. 3 Estimates of delinquencies are based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association and from First American LoanPerformance. 4 Foreclosure starts are based on data from the Mortgage Bankers Association  adjusted to reflect the limited coverage of their sample. Historically  about half of foreclosure starts resulted in the borrower losing the home  but recent rates appear higher. 2 BIS Review 152/2008 (GSEs)  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  The Federal Reserve has also implemented a series of actions aimed at restoring the normal functioning of financial markets and restarting the flow of credit  including providing liquidity to a range of financial institutions  working with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to help stabilize the banking system  and providing backstop liquidity to the commercial paper market. The Federal Reserve supported the actions by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Treasury to put the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises into conservatorship  thereby stabilizing a critical source of mortgage credit. The Federal Reserve has also recently announced that it will purchase up to $100 billion of the debt issued by Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac  and the Federal Home Loan Banks and up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs. Although broad-based macroeconomic policies help to create an economic and financial environment in which a housing recovery can occur  policies aimed more narrowly at the housing market are important  too. In the remainder of my remarks  I will focus on policy options for reducing preventable foreclosures. Foreclosures impose large costs on families who face the loss of their homes and reduced future access to credit. But the public policy case for reducing preventable foreclosures does not rely solely on the desire to help people who are in trouble. Foreclosures create substantial social costs. Communities suffer when foreclosures are clustered  adding further to the downward pressure on property values. Lower property values in turn translate to lower tax revenues for local governments  and increases in the number of vacant homes can foster vandalism and crime.5 At the national level  the declines in house prices that result from the addition of foreclosed properties to the supply of homes for sale create broader economic and financial stress  as I have already noted.6 On the surface  private economic incentives to avoid foreclosure would appear to be strong for the lender as well as the borrower. Foreclosure dissipates much of the value of the property: Indeed  recent losses on defaulted subprime mortgages have averaged around 50 to 60 percent of the loan balance.7 Besides the general decline in property values and foregone payments  fees related to foreclosure  such as court costs  maintenance expenses  and others  can amount to 10 to 15 percent of the loan balance; furthermore  the discount in value due to foreclosure status can be an additional 5 to 15 percent.8 However  despite the substantial costs imposed by foreclosure  anecdotal evidence suggests that some foreclosures are continuing to occur even in cases in which the narrow economic interests of the lender would appear to be better served through modification of the mortgage. This apparent market failure owes in part to the widespread practice of securitizing mortgages  which typically results in their being put into the hands of third-party 5 For evidence that concentrations of foreclosures lead to lower house prices throughout the neighborhood  see  for example  William C. Apgar  Mark Duda  and Rochelle Nawrocki Gorey (2005)  "The Municipal Cost of Foreclosures: A Chicago Case Study"  Housing Finance Policy Research Paper 2005-1 (Minneapolis  Minn.: Homeownership February)  www.995hope.org/content/pdf/Apgar_Duda_Study_Full_Version.pdf; and John P.

Preservation Foundation  6 To be sure  policy should not attempt to keep house prices from falling sufficiently to stabilize the demand for housing. But preventing avoidable foreclosures does not block necessary adjustments. Indeed  failing to prevent such foreclosures may heighten the risk that house prices will move lower than they would otherwise need to go. 7 See J.P. Morgan (2008)  "SOS - Summary of Subprime  Alt-A  Prime Jumbo"  Global Structured Finance Research (November 2); and Credit Suisse (2008)  "Deep Dive into Subprime Mortgage Severity"  Fixed Income Research Report (June 19). 8 See "Deep Dive"  note 8. BIS Review 152/2008 3 lenders  including portfolio servicers rather than those of a single owner or lender. The rules under which servicers operate do not always provide them with clear guidance or the appropriate incentives to undertake economically sensible modifications.9 The problem is exacerbated because some modifications may benefit some tranches of the securities more than others  raising the risk of investor lawsuits. More generally  the sheer volume of delinquent loans has overwhelmed the capacity of many servicers  to undertake effective modifications. During more normal times  mortgage delinquencies typically were triggered by life events  such as unemployment  illness  or divorce  and servicers became accustomed to addressing these problems on a case-by-case basis. Although taking account of the specific circumstances of each case remains important  the scale of the current problem calls for greater standardization and efficiency. Loan modification programs with clearly defined protocols can both help reduce modification costs and protect servicers from the charge that they have acted arbitrarily. The federal banking regulators have urged lenders and servicers to work with borrowers to avoid preventable foreclosures. The regulators recently reiterated that position in a joint statement that encouraged banks to make the necessary investments in staff and capacity to meet the escalating workload and to adopt systematic  proactive  and streamlined modification protocols to put borrowers in sustainable mortgages.10 A number of initiatives have attempted to address the problem of unnecessary foreclosures. Working in collaboration with the Treasury Department  the Hope Now Alliance  a coalition of mortgage servicers  lenders  housing counselors  and investors – led by Faith Schwartz  a member of the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council – has produced a set of guidelines that participating servicers have agreed to use as they work to prevent foreclosures. In addition  servicers in the Alliance agreed to delay foreclosure proceedings if an alternative approach might allow the homeowners to stay in their home. Recently  in conjunction with the FHFA  the coalition announced that its members will adopt a streamlined modification program for certain loans that they service for the GSEs. This program will closely follow the one that the FDIC has introduced for modifying the loans in the portfolio that it took over from IndyMac.11 The Federal Reserve has also been actively supporting efforts to prevent unnecessary foreclosures. Through the System's Homeownership and Mortgage Initiative  we have conducted studies on housing and foreclosures  provided community leaders with detailed analyses to help them better target their borrower outreach and counseling efforts  and convened forums like this one to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the development of policy options. Taking advantage of the Federal Reserve's nationwide presence  the twelve Reserve Banks have sponsored or co-sponsored more than 100 events related to foreclosures around the country since last summer  bringing together more than 10 000 lenders  counselors  community development specialists  and policymakers. A particular focus of the Fed's efforts has been the mitigation of the costs to communities of high rates of foreclosure. For example  we have partnered with NeighborWorks America on a neighborhood stabilization project and helped them develop responses to community needs as well as train local leaders. 9 Servicers of mortgages in securitized pools must abide by the pooling and servicing agreements  which state what modifications may be prohibited but provide limited guidance about what types of modifications investors would consider to be appropriate. See Larry Cordell  Karen Dynan  Andreas Lehnert  Nellie Liang  and Eileen Mauskopf (2008)  "The Incentives of Mortgage Servicers: Myths and Realities"  Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2008-46 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  November). 10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  and Office of Thrift Supervision (2008)  "Interagency Statement on Meeting the Needs of Creditworthy Borrowers"  joint press release  November 12. 11 In addition  Hope Now has been an important source of data on loss-mitigation activity. The loan-level data that they plan to provide in the future will be useful for analyzing the relative effectiveness of alternative strategies for loan modifications. 4 BIS Review 152/2008 Beyond these efforts  two government programs to facilitate loan modifications have been authorized  both through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The FHASecure program has provided long-term fixed-rate mortgages to borrowers facing a rise in payments due to an interest rate reset. Another  more recent program  dubbed Hope for Homeowners (H4H)  allows lenders to refinance a delinquent borrower into a new  FHA-insured fixed-rate mortgage if the lender writes down the mortgage balance to create some home equity for the borrower and pays an up-front insurance premium. In exchange for being put "above water" on the mortgage  the borrower is required to share any subsequent appreciation of the home with the government. Although the basic structure of the H4H program is appealing  some lenders have expressed concerns about its complexity and cost  including the requirement in many cases to undertake substantial principal write-downs. As a result  participation has thus far been low. In response to these concerns  the board of the H4H program – on which Governor Duke represents the Federal Reserve – recently approved a number of changes  using the authority granted to it under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA). These changes would reduce the necessary write-down on some loans  address the complications caused by subordinate liens by permitting up-front payments to those lien holders  allow lenders to extend mortgage terms from 30 to 40 years to increase affordability  and eliminate the trial modification period to expedite loan closings. It is still too early to know what the ultimate demand for H4H loans under this set of rules will be  but as I will discuss further momentarily  a case can be made for further adjusting the terms of the program to make it more attractive to both lenders and borrowers. Despite good-faith efforts by both the private and public sectors  the foreclosure rate remains too high  with adverse consequences for both those directly involved and for the broader economy. More needs to be done. In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss  without ranking  a few promising options for reducing avoidable foreclosures. These proposals are not mutually exclusive and could be used in combination. Each would require some commitment of public funds. To be effective  loan modifications should aim to put borrowers into mortgages that they can afford over the longer term. During more normal times  many homeowners could be helped with a temporary repayment plan – for example  a deferral of interest payments for a period. But under the current circumstances  with house prices declining and credit tight  permanent loan modifications will often be needed to create sustainable mortgages and keep people in their homes. Most current proposals to reduce foreclosures incorporate this view and thus emphasize permanent modifications. A more difficult design question turns on the extent to which the probability of default or redefault depends on the borrower's equity position in the home  as well as on the affordability of the monthly payment. Although not conclusive  the available evidence suggests that the homeowner's equity position is  along with affordability  an important determinant of default rates  for owner-occupiers as well as investors. If that evidence is correct  then principal write-downs may need to be part of the toolkit that servicers use to achieve sustainable mortgage modifications.12 12 Studies tend to find that equity positions matter most for default rates when they interact with other contributing factors; for example  numerous studies have found that borrowers are more likely to default when house prices have fallen and incomes decline. At the household level  such "double triggers" may induce defaults because of cash flow constraints or because continuing to make payments on a mortgage whose balance significantly exceeds the value of the house is more difficult to justify when the family budget is strained. See Shane Sherlund (forthcoming)  "The Past  Present  and Future of Subprime Mortgages"  Finance and Economics Discussion Series (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System); Kristopher Gerardi  Christopher L. Foote  and Paul S. Willen (2008)  "Negative Equity and Foreclosure: Theory and Evidence"  Public Policy Discussion Papers 08-3 (Boston: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  BIS Review 152/2008 5 If one accepts the view that principal write-downs may be needed in cases of badly underwater mortgages  then strengthening the H4H program is a promising strategy  as I have noted. Beyond the steps already taken by the H4H board  the Congress might consider making the terms of H4H loans more attractive by reducing the up-front insurance premium paid by the lender  currently set in law at 3 percent of the principal value  as well as the annual premium paid by the borrower  currently set at 1-1/2 percent. The Congress might also grant the FHA the flexibility to tailor these premiums to individual risk characteristics rather than forcing the FHA to charge the same premium to all borrowers. In addition  consideration might be given to reducing the interest rate that borrowers would pay under the H4H program. At present  this rate is expected to be quite high  roughly 8 percent  in part because it is tied to the demand for the relatively illiquid securities issued by Ginnie Mae to fund the program. To bring down this rate  the Treasury could exercise its authority to purchase these securities  with the Congress providing the appropriate increase in the debt ceiling to accommodate those purchases. Alternatively  the Congress could decide to subsidize the rate. A second proposal  put forward by the FDIC  focuses on improving the affordability of monthly payments. Under the FDIC plan  servicers would restructure delinquent mortgages using a streamlined process  modeled on the IndyMac protocol  and would aim to reduce monthly payments to 31 percent of the borrower's income. As an inducement to lenders and servicers to undertake these modifications  the government would offer to share in any losses sustained in the event of redefaults on the modified mortgages and would also pay $1 000 to the servicer for each modification completed.13 The strengths of this plan include the standardization of the restructuring process and the fact that the restructured loans remain with the servicer  with the government being involved only when a redefault occurs. As noted  the FDIC plan would induce lenders and servicers to modify loans by offering a form of insurance against downside house price risk. A third approach would have the government share the cost when the servicer reduces the borrower's monthly payment. For example  a servicer could initiate a modification and bear the costs of reducing the mortgage payment to 38 percent of income  after which the government could bear a portion of the incremental cost of reducing the mortgage payments beyond 38 percent  say to 31 percent  of income. This approach would increase the incentive of servicers to be aggressive in reducing monthly payments  which would improve the prospects for sustainability. Relative to the FDIC proposal  this plan would pose a greater operational burden on the government  which would be required to make payments to servicers for all modified loans  not just for loans leverage existing modification frameworks  such as the FDIC/IndyMac and Hope Now streamlined protocols  and in this respect would build on  rather than crowd out  private-sector initiatives. Yet another promising proposal for foreclosure prevention would have the government purchase delinquent or at-risk mortgages in bulk and then refinance them into the H4H or another FHA program. This approach could take advantage of the depressed market values of such mortgages  and buying in bulk might help avoid adverse selection problems. In that redefault. However  this approach could June); and Haughwout  Andrew  Richard Peach  and Joseph Tracy (forthcoming)  "Juvenile Delinquent Mortgages: Bad Credit or Bad Economy?" Journal of Urban Economics. 13 The original plan would have had the government share half of any loss incurred by the lender  regardless of how far underwater the loan might have already been by the time of modification. The latest version of the plan modifies this provision by offering lower loss-sharing rates for loans that have loan-to-value (LTV) ratios above 100 percent at the time of the modification. Under the modified plan  the loss-sharing rate declines from 50 percent on a loan with an LTV of 100 percent at the time of modification to 20 percent on a loan with a LTV of 150 percent. Loans with LTVs of more than 150 percent at the time of modification do not qualify for loss- sharing. An alternative way to address this concern would be to base the amount of the government insurance payment on the loss in value relative to the appraised value of the property at the time of the loan modification. 6 BIS Review 152/2008 addition  scale efficiencies could be achieved by contracting with specialty firms (perhaps including the GSEs) capable of re-underwriting large volumes of loans to make them eligible for H4H or another program. The Treasury has already considered how to undertake bulk purchases as part of its work under EESA  and the Federal Reserve has submitted to the Congress an analysis of bulk purchases per a legislative requirement in the H4H bill. Even so  this program could take some time to get up and running  and the re-underwriting required for H4H loans would likely take more time and incur greater operational costs than other plans. But such an approach could result in many homeowners being refinanced into sustainable mortgages. Conclusion The housing market remains central to the economic and financial challenges that we face. Because housing and mortgage markets are tightly interlinked with the rest of the economy  actions to strengthen financial markets and the broader economy are important ways to address housing issues. By the same token  steps that stabilize the housing market will help stabilize the economy as well. In this regard  reducing the number of preventable foreclosures would not only help families stay in their homes  it would confer much wider benefits. Significant efforts have been taken in this direction  but more can be done. Today I have briefly discussed a few promising options  which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. As we as a country consider ways to address our financial and economic challenges  policy initiatives to reduce the number of preventable foreclosures should be high on the agenda.
