Duvvuri Subbarao: Quantitative easing – unconventional policy response to the financial crisis Remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao  Governor of the Reserve Bank of India  while welcoming Mr Ben Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Reserve Bank of India  Mumbai  10 October 2012. I am delighted to welcome Chairman Ben Bernanke to the Reserve Bank and to this meeting with the Top Management Group of RBI. like It would be presumptuous on my part Ben Bernanke  especially to a gathering of central bank staff. I will do so nevertheless  if only to pay homage to a tradition. legendary personality introduce a to Crisis – an intellectual challenge As we all know  the crisis was an intellectual challenge as it called into question many of our beliefs and theories  and reopened issues that we thought had been settled. Clearly  it demanded a policy response that went beyond conventional economics. As central bankers started battling the crisis  ferociously easing monetary policy  leading the intellectual charge from the front was Chairman Bernanke. Unconventional policies Through his resort to unconventional policies  Ben Bernanke demonstrated the enormous range  depth and power of the central bank policy arsenal. In doing so  he drew not only from his impressive scholarship of the Great Depression  but also from the lessons of several post-war crises  including the long slow down in Japan. This is a rare instance of academic economics being tested in real time. As an academic and as a policy maker  Chairman Bernanke was ahead of others in recognizing the limits of conventional monetary policy. As someone quipped  he believed strongly that it is better to succeed through unconventional policies than to fail through conventional policies! In a scenario where the policy interest rate was already at the zero lower bound  he had advocated a money-financed tax cut  essentially equivalent to a “helicopter drop” of money (earning him the sobriquet “Helicopter Ben”). Unlike a bond- financed tax-cut  which leads to tax increases down the line  a tax cut financed by money creation should  in theory  not emasculate fiscal expansion through the Ricardian Equivalence. Quantitative Easing (QE) The Federal Reserve under Bernanke was not  of course  the first central bank to deploy quantitative easing (QE). The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is considered to be the pioneer in this regard. However  where Chairman Bernanke stood out was that he used QE far more aggressively than the BoJ ever did  introducing innovations as he went along. QE became “credit easing” when private assets were bought to stabilize financial markets  followed by another unconventional move – “operation twist” – to intervene directly at the long end of the yield curve with offsetting interventions at the short-end. The latest version of QE  as we all know  is an open ended commitment to purchase mortgage backed securities at the rate of $40 billion per month for as long as the “labour market does not improve substantially”. QE  in all its variations  was able to halt the downward deflationary spiral by making up for the declining velocity of money caused by deleveraging. It kept sovereign borrowing rates BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 low in the face of a market revolt. It helped clean up the balance sheets of stressed financial institutions through cheap funding. The recovery from the Great Recession was relatively quick; at least that was how it seemed through the “green shoots” of 2010. Now  of course  we are no longer so sure. The limitations of macroeconomic techniques honed through deconstructing the Great Depression  the inflationary seventies and to see. Quite understandably  therefore  QE has its critics. It may be relevant to recall some of the criticism. the Great Moderation are for all there Criticism of QE The main criticism has been that QE is being continued beyond its usefulness. What the US economy requires now is a fiscal stimulus  and further QE is no substitute for a fiscal stimulus. It would only stoke inflationary pressures down the line. A second criticism  in fact a corollary to the first one  has been the argument that stretching monetary policy to unconventional levels has obliterated the firewall between fiscal and monetary policies  with monetary policy increasingly becoming an extension of fiscal policy  thereby renewing concerns about the fiscal dominance of monetary policy. Third  whereas fiscal stimulus leads to higher taxes down the line  the combination of zero- bound interest rates and QE is an immediate tax on savers  who in effect finance the stimulus. This tax on savings should induce people to consume and invest more  and save less. But with impaired balance sheets  they are possibly saving even more. Given this outcome  some have questioned the circumstances under which and the extent to which QE can trigger a virtuous cycle of demand for and supply of credit to the real economy. Fourth  there has been criticism from some emerging markets alleging that the excess liquidity unleashed by QE is fuelling volatile capital flows  asset bubbles and inflation and also spiking up commodity prices. Finally  the Fed is being challenged on the risks in the process of unwinding QE  in particular of how this could be managed consistent with price stability and financial stability. Chairman Bernanke has responded to the above criticism on several occasions from various platforms. He has also found an innovative answer for each new problem thrown at him so far. This is all the more remarkable given that there is no recent real life experience to draw from. Central banks and the new trilemma As a central bank  we empathize with the Fed’s concerns. The crisis has pushed central bank policy making into uncharted territory. We will not know for many years whether the policy mix we have followed to manage the crisis is right. Even so  in real time  all of us have to struggle with the challenge of managing the new trilemma – of balancing fiscal sustainability  price stability and financial stability. Communication policies Chairman Bernanke’s unconventional policies have extended beyond the content of policy to its communication. Hard as it might be to imagine from today’s perspective  prior to 1994  the Federal Reserve was not actually announcing the target Fed Funds Rate; the market was expected to infer the rate from the timing  sequencing and magnitude of its open market operations. In sharp contrast  today the Fed not only explicitly announces the rate but also gives a clear indication of the future policy trajectory. Like Chairman Bernanke has carried his policies to an unconventional level  he has carried their communication also to an 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches unconventional level by shaping and managing expectations through post-policy press conferences and town hall meetings. Bernanke’s legacy All in all  because of what he did  what he said  and above all because he stuck to his convictions honed through deep scholarship  Chairman Bernanke will have a profound and lasting influence on the theory and practice of central banking. In the world of policy  he might be remembered for fashioning the monetary policy of the 21st century. In the world of academia  he will probably earn the ultimate honour an academic craves if his real world practice of economics becomes the stuff of text books. Once again  I have great pleasure in welcoming Chairman Bernanke to the Reserve Bank. Ben  we are truly delighted to have you with us and look forward to hearing you. BIS central bankers’ speeches 3
