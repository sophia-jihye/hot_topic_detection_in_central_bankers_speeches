Ben S Bernanke: A century of US central banking – goals, frameworks, 
accountability  
Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System,  at  “The  First  100  Years  of  the  Federal  Reserve:  The  Policy  Record,  Lessons 
Learned, and Prospects for the Future,” a conference sponsored by the National Bureau of 
Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 10 July 2013. 
 I’d like to thank the National Bureau of Economic Research for organizing this conference in 
recognition  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  centennial,  and  I’m  glad  to  have  the  opportunity  to 
participate.  In  keeping  with  the  spirit  of  the  conference,  my  remarks  today  will  take  a 
historical perspective. I will leave discussion of current policy to today’s question-and-answer 
session and, of course, to my congressional testimony next week.  
Today,  I’ll  discuss  the  evolution  over  the  past  100  years  of  three  key  aspects  of  Federal 
Reserve  policymaking:  the  goals  of  policy,  the  policy  framework,  and  accountability  and 
communication. The changes over time in these three areas provide a useful perspective, I 
believe,  on  how  the  role  and  functioning  of  the  Federal  Reserve  have  changed  since  its 
founding  in  1913,  as  well  as  some  lessons  for  the  present  and  for  the  future.  I  will  pay 
particular  attention  to  several  key  episodes  of  the  Fed’s  history,  all  of  which  have  been 
referred  to  in  various  contexts  with  the  adjective  “Great”  attached  to  them:  the  Great 
Experiment of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the Great Depression, the Great Inflation and 
subsequent disinflation, the Great Moderation, and the recent Great Recession.  
The Great Experiment 
In  the  words  of  one  of  the  authors  of the  Federal  Reserve  Act,  Robert Latham Owen,  the 
Federal Reserve was established to “provide a means by which periodic panics which shake 
the American Republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped.”1 In short, the original goal 
of the Great Experiment that was the founding of the Fed was the preservation of financial 
stability.2  At  the  time,  the  standard  view  of  panics  was  that  they  were  triggered  when  the 
needs of business and agriculture for liquid funds outstripped the available supply – as when 
seasonal plantings or shipments of crops had to be financed, for example – and that panics 
were further exacerbated by the incentives of banks and private individuals to hoard liquidity 
during such times.3 The new institution was intended to relieve such strains by providing an 
“elastic”  currency  –  that  is,  by  providing  liquidity  as  needed  to  individual  member  banks 
through  the  discount  window;  commercial  banks,  in  turn,  would  then  be  able  to 
accommodate  their  customers.  Interestingly,  although  congressional  advocates  hoped  the 
creation of the Fed would help prevent future panics, they did not fully embrace the idea that 
the  Fed  should  help  end  ongoing  panics  by  serving  as  lender  of  last  resort,  as  had  been 
                                                
1  See Owen (1919, p. 24). The Treasury carried out some central banking functions before the creation of the 
Federal Reserve. In addition, the United States had experimented with central banking before, with the First 
and  Second  Banks  of  the  United  States.  By  1913,  however,  it  had  been  about  75  years  since  the  latter 
institution  had  ceased  fulfilling  that  purpose.  Moreover,  the  Federal  Reserve  operated  somewhat  differently 
from the prior institutions, and, in that respect, its creation amounted to an experiment. 
2  Per a review of the 1929 book Wall Street and Washington in the New York Times, “The Federal Reserve 
System  has  from  the  first  necessarily  been  a  great  experiment,  bound  to  adjust  its  general  policies  to  the 
requirements of such novel and varying situations as should arise in the course of our financial history and 
which could not possibly be foreseen” (Noyes, 1929). 
3  Friedman  and  Schwartz  (1963)  describe  the  debate  about  the  elastic  currency.  Warburg  (1914)  discusses 
hoarding and the panic dynamics that the Federal Reserve was established to prevent.

recommended  by  the  British  economist  and  writer  Walter  Bagehot.4  Legislators  imposed 
limits on the Federal Reserve’s ability to lend in response to panics, for example, by denying 
nonmember banks access to the discount window and by restricting the types of collateral 
that the Fed could accept.5  
The  framework  that  the  Federal  Reserve  employed  in  its  early  years  to  promote  financial 
stability reflected in large measure the influence of the so-called real bills doctrine, as well as 
the fact that the United States was on the gold standard.6 In the framework of the real bills 
doctrine, the Federal Reserve saw its function as meeting the needs of business for liquidity 
–  consistent  with  the  idea  of  providing  an  elastic  currency  –  with  the  ultimate  goal  of 
supporting  financial  and  economic  stability.7  When  business  activity  was  increasing,  the 
Federal  Reserve  helped  accommodate  the  need  for  credit  by  supplying  liquidity  to  banks; 
when business was contracting and less credit was needed, the Fed reduced the liquidity in 
the system.  
As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve pursued this approach to policy in the context of the 
gold standard. Federal Reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand, and the Fed was 
required  to  maintain  a  gold  reserve  equal  to  40  percent  of  outstanding  notes.  However, 
contrary  to  the  principles  of  an  idealized  gold  standard,  the  Federal  Reserve  often  took 
actions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully translated into changes in the 
domestic money supply.8 This practice, together with the size of the U.S. economy, gave the 
Federal  Reserve  considerable  autonomy  in  monetary  policy  and,  in  particular,  allowed  the 
Fed to conduct policy according to the real bills doctrine without much hindrance.  
The  policy  framework  of  the  Fed’s  early  years  has  been  much  criticized  in  retrospect. 
Although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained U.S. monetary policy 
in  the  years  after  the  Fed’s  founding,  subsequent  research  has  highlighted  the  extent  to 
which  the  international  gold  standard  served  to  destabilize  the  global  economy  in  the  late 
1920s and early 1930s.9 Likewise, economic historians have pointed out that, under the real 
bills doctrine, the Fed increased the money supply precisely at those times at which business 
activity  and  upward  pressures  on  prices  were  strongest;  that  is,  monetary  policy  was 
procyclical. Thus, the Fed’s actions tended to increase rather than decrease the volatility in 
economic activity and prices.10  
During this early period, the new central bank did make an important addition to its menu of 
policy tools. Initially, the Fed’s main tools were the quantity of its lending through the discount 
                                                
4  See Willis (1923, p. 1407), Carlson and Wheelock (2012), and Bordo and Wheelock (2013). Bagehot ([1873] 
1897) is the source of the classic dictum that a panic should be addressed by the central bank, by lending 
freely at a penalty rate. 
5  The  Monetary  Control  Act  of  1980  gave  all  depository  institutions  access  to  the  discount  window.  The 
collateral  acceptable  to  be  pledged  to  the  discount  window  has  been  expanded  significantly  over  time;  in 
particular,  various  pieces  of  banking  legislation  in  the  early  1930s  enabled  the  Federal  Reserve  to  make 
advances to member banks so long as the loans were “secured to the satisfaction” of the Federal Reserve 
Bank extending the loan. 
6  See Humphrey (1982) for a discussion of the historical evolution of the real bills doctrine. 
7  This  interpretation  follows  from  the  discussion  in  the  Tenth  Annual  Report  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board 
(Board of Governors, 1924). Soon after the Federal Reserve was founded, its mission shifted to supporting the 
war  effort  and then to managing  the  unwinding  of  that  support.  The  year  1923  was  thus  one  of  the first  in 
which the Federal Reserve confronted normal peacetime financial conditions, and it took the opportunity to 
articulate its views on the appropriate conduct of policy in such conditions. 
8  The  Federal  Reserve  could  undo  the  effects  of  gold  inflows  on  the  domestic  money  supply  through  open 
market operations, discussed later.

window  and  the  interest  rate  at  which  it  lent,  the  discount  rate.  Early  on,  however,  to 
generate  earnings  to  finance  its  operations,  the  Federal  Reserve  began  purchasing 
government  securities  in  the  open  market  –  what  came  to  be  known  as  open  market 
operations.  In  the  early  1920s,  Fed  officials  discovered  that  these  operations  affected  the 
supply  and  cost  of  bank  reserves  and,  consequently,  the  terms  on  which  banks  extended 
credit  to  their  customers.  Subsequently,  of  course,  open  market  operations  became  a 
principal monetary policy tool, one that allowed the Fed to interact with the broader financial 
markets, not only with banks.11  
I’ve discussed the original mandate and early policy framework of the Fed. What about its 
accountability  to  the  public?  As  this  audience  knows,  when  the  Federal  Reserve  was 
established, the question of whether it should be a private or a public institution was highly 
contentious.  The  compromise  solution  created  a  hybrid  Federal  Reserve  System.  The 
System  was  headed  by  a  governmentally  appointed  Board,  which  initially  included  the 
Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency. But the 12 regional Reserve 
Banks were placed under a mixture of public and private oversight, including board members 
drawn  from  the  private  sector,  and  they  were  given  considerable  scope  to  make  policy 
decisions that applied to their own Districts. For example, Reserve Banks were permitted to 
set their own discount rates, subject to a minimum set by the Board.  
While  the  founders  of  the  Federal  Reserve  hoped  that  this  new  institution  would  provide 
financial  and  hence  economic  stability,  the  policy  framework  and  the  institutional  structure 
would prove inadequate to the challenges the Fed would soon face.  
The Great Depression 
The Great Depression was the Federal Reserve’s most difficult test. Tragically, the Fed failed 
to  meet  its mandate to maintain financial  stability.  In  particular,  although  the  Fed  provided 
substantial  liquidity  to  the  financial  system  following  the  1929  stock  market  crash,  its 
response to the subsequent banking panics was limited at best; the widespread bank failures 
and  the  collapse  in  money  and  credit  that  ensued  were  major  sources  of  the  economic 
downturn.12 Bagehot’s dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in the face of panic appeared to 
have few adherents at the Federal Reserve of that era.13  
Economists have also identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the early 1930s 
when Federal Reserve officials, in the face of the sharp economic contraction and financial 
upheaval,  either  tightened  monetary  policy  or  chose  inaction.  Some  historians  trace  these 
policy mistakes to the early death of Benjamin Strong, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of  New  York,  in  1928,  which  left  the  decentralized  system  without  an  effective  leader.14 
Whether  valid  or  not,  this  hypothesis  raises  the  interesting  question  of  what  intellectual 
framework an effective leader would have drawn on at the time to develop and justify a more 
activist  monetary  policy.  The  degree  to  which  the  gold  standard  actually  constrained  U.S. 
monetary policy during the early 1930s is debated; but the gold standard philosophy clearly 
did not encourage the sort of highly expansionary policies that were needed.15 The same can 
                                                
11  See Strong (1926). 
12  See Friedman and Schwartz (1963). 
13  Meltzer (2003, pp. 282, 729–30) notes that Board members discussed Bagehot’s ideas but nevertheless did 
not integrate them fully into their approach to policy. 
14  See Friedman and Schwartz (1963, chapter 7). 
15  Wicker (1965), Temin (1989), and Eichengreen (1992) suggest that U.S. policymakers felt constrained by the 
gold standard. In contrast, Hsieh and Romer (2006), as well as Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz (2002), focus 
on the short-lived monetary expansion in 1932 as evidence against the existence of important constraints on 
the Federal Reserve.

be  said  for  the  real  bills  doctrine,  which  apparently  led  policymakers  to  conclude,  on  the 
basis of low nominal interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed, that monetary policy 
was  appropriately  supportive  and  that  further  actions  would  be  fruitless.16  Historians  have 
also noted the prevalence at the time of yet another counterproductive doctrine: the so-called 
liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.17 It may be that 
the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the lack of 
an  intellectual  framework  for  understanding  what  was  happening  and  what  needed  to  be 
done.  
The Fed’s inadequate policy frameworks ultimately collapsed under the weight of economic 
failures,  new  ideas,  and  political  developments.  The  international  gold  standard  was 
abandoned during the 1930s. The real bills doctrine likewise lost prestige after the disaster of 
the 1930s; for example, the Banking Act of 1935 instructed the Federal Reserve to use open 
market operations with consideration of “the general credit situation of the country,” not just 
to  focus  narrowly  on  short-term  liquidity  needs.18  The  Congress  also  expanded  the  Fed’s 
ability  to  provide  credit  through  the  discount  window,  allowing  loans  to  a  broader  array  of 
counterparties, secured by a broader variety of collateral.19  
The experience of the Great Depression had major ramifications for all three aspects of the 
Federal Reserve I am discussing here: its goals, its policy framework, and its accountability 
to the public. With respect to goals, the high unemployment of the Depression – and the fear 
that high unemployment would return after World War II – elevated the maintenance of full 
employment  as  a  goal  of  macroeconomic  policy.  The  Employment  Act  of  1946  made  the 
promotion of employment a general objective for the federal government. Although the Fed 
did  not  have  a  formal  employment  goal  until  the  Federal  Reserve  Reform  Act  of  1977 
codified  “maximum  employment,”  along  with  “stable  prices,”  as  part  of  the  Fed’s  so-called 
dual  mandate,  earlier  legislation  nudged  the  central  bank  in  that  direction.20  For  example, 
legislators described the intent of the Banking Act of 1935 as follows: “To increase the ability 
of  the  banking  system  to  promote  stability  of  employment  and  business,  insofar  as  this  is 
possible within the scope of monetary action and credit administration.”21  
The  policy  framework  to  support  this  new  approach  reflected  the  development  of 
macroeconomic theories – including the work of Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, Ralph Hawtrey, 
Dennis Robertson, and John Maynard Keynes – that laid the foundations for understanding 
how  monetary  policy  could  affect  real  activity  and  employment  and  help  reduce  cyclical 
fluctuations.  At  the  same  time,  the  Federal  Reserve  became  less  focused  on  its  original 
mandate of preserving financial stability, perhaps in part because it felt superseded by the 
creation during the 1930s of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission, along with other reforms intended to make the financial system 
more stable.  
                                                
16  See Meltzer (2003) and Romer and Romer (2013). 
17  See, for example, DeLong (1990). 
18  This language amended section 12A(c) of the Federal Reserve Act. 
19  For  example,  section  10B  enhanced  the  powers  of  the  Federal  Reserve  to  lend  to  member  banks,  and 
sections  13(3)  and  13(13)  enabled  the  Federal  Reserve  to  provide  short-term  credit  to  a  wide  range  of 
potential borrowers in specific circumstances. 
20  More precisely, the three statutory objectives for monetary policy set forth in the Federal Reserve Reform Act 
of 1977 are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The dual mandate 
refers  to  the  first  two  goals,  and  the  long-term  interest  rate  goal  is  viewed  as  likely  to  emerge  from  the 
macroeconomic  environment  associated  with  achievement  of  the  employment  and  price  stability  goals 
(Mishkin, 2007). Thus, the interest rate goal of the Federal Reserve Reform Act can be regarded as subsumed 
within the dual mandate.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
In the area of governance and accountability to the public, policymakers also recognized the 
need  for  reforms  to  improve  the  Federal  Reserve’s  structure  and  decisionmaking.  The 
Banking  Act  of  1935  simultaneously  bolstered  the  legal  independence  of  the  Federal 
Reserve  and  provided  for  stronger  central  control  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Board.  In 
particular, the act created the modern configuration of the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC),  giving  the  Board  the  majority  of  votes  on  the  Committee,  while  removing  the 
Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency from the Board. In practice, 
however, the Treasury continued to have considerable sway over monetary policy after 1933, 
with one economic historian describing the Fed as “in the back seat.”22 During World War II, 
the Federal Reserve used its tools to support the war financing efforts. However, even after 
the war, Federal Reserve policy remained subject to considerable Treasury influence. It was 
not  until  the  1951  Accord  with  the  Treasury  that  the  Federal  Reserve  began  to  recover 
genuine independence in setting monetary policy.  
The Great Inflation and Disinflation 
Once the Federal Reserve regained its policy independence, its goals centered on the price 
stability  and  employment  objectives  laid  out  in  the  Employment  Act  of  1946.  In  the  early 
postwar decades, the Fed used open market operations and the discount rate to influence 
short-term  market  interest  rates,  and  the  federal  funds  rate  gradually  emerged  as  the 
preferred operating target. Low and stable inflation was achieved for most of the 1950s and 
the early 1960s. However, beginning in the mid-1960s, inflation began a long climb upward, 
partly  because  policymakers  proved  to  be  too  optimistic  about  the  economy’s  ability  to 
sustain rapid growth without inflation.23  
Two  mechanisms  might  have  mitigated  the  damage  from  that  mistaken  optimism.  First,  a 
stronger policy response to inflation – more like that observed in the 1950s – certainly would 
have helped.24 Second, Fed policymakers could have reacted to continued high readings on 
inflation  by  adopting  a  more  realistic  assessment  of  the  economy’s  productive  potential.25 
Instead,  policymakers  chose  to  emphasize  so-called  cost-push  and  structural  factors  as 
sources  of  inflation  and  saw  wage-  and  price-setting  as  having  become  insensitive  to 
economic slack.26 This perspective, which contrasted sharply with Milton Friedman’s famous 
dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” led to Fed support 
for  measures  such  as  wage  and  price  controls  rather  than  monetary  solutions  to  address 
inflation.27 A further obstacle was the view among many economists that the gains from low 
inflation did not justify the costs of achieving it.28  
The  consequence  of  the  monetary  framework  of  the  1970s  was  two  bouts  of  double-digit 
inflation. Moreover, by the end of the decade, lack of commitment to controlling inflation had 
clearly resulted in inflation expectations becoming “unanchored,” with high estimates of trend 
inflation embedded in longer-term interest rates.

reaction.  See  Judd  and  Rudebusch  (1998);  Taylor  (1999a);  and  Clarida,  Galí,  and  Gertler  (2000).  For  the 
quotation, see Friedman (1963, p.17).

As you know, under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal Reserve in 1979 
fundamentally  changed  its  approach  to  the  issue  of  ensuring  price  stability.  This  change 
involved  an  important  rethinking  on  the  part  of  policymakers.  By  the  end  of  the  1970s, 
Federal  Reserve  officials  increasingly  accepted  the  view  that  inflation  is  a  monetary 
phenomenon, at least in the medium and longer term; they became more alert to the risks of 
excessive  optimism  about  the  economy’s  potential  output;  and  they  placed  renewed 
emphasis on the distinction between real – that is, inflation-adjusted – and nominal interest 
rates.29 The change in policy framework was initially tied to a change in operating procedures 
that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but the critical change – the willingness to 
respond more vigorously to inflation – endured even after the Federal Reserve resumed its 
traditional  use  of  the  federal  funds  rate  as  the  policy  instrument.30  The  new  regime  also 
reflected an improved understanding of the importance of providing a firm anchor, secured 
by the credibility of the central bank, for the private sector’s inflation expectations.31 Finally, it 
entailed  a  changed  view  about  the  dual  mandate,  in  which  policymakers  regarded 
achievement  of  price  stability  as  helping  to  provide  the  conditions  necessary for  sustained 
maximum employment.32  
The Great Moderation 
Volcker’s successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called Great Moderation 
of  1984  to  2007,  during  which  the  Fed  enjoyed  considerable  success  in  achieving  both 
objectives  of  its  dual  mandate.  Financial  stability  remained  a  goal,  of  course. The  Federal 
Reserve monitored threats to financial stability and responded when the financial system was 
upset by events such as the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of 2001. More 
routinely,  it  shared  supervisory  duties  with  other  banking  agencies.  Nevertheless,  for  the 
most part, financial stability did not figure prominently in monetary policy discussions during 
these years. In retrospect, it is clear that macroeconomists – both inside and outside central 
banks  –  relied  too  heavily  during  that  period  on  variants  of  the  so-called  Modigliani-Miller 
theorem, an implication of which is that the details of the structure of the financial system can 
be ignored when analyzing the behavior of the broader economy.  
An important development of the Great Moderation was the increasing emphasis that central 
banks  around  the  world  put  on  communication  and  transparency,  as  economists  and 
policymakers reached consensus on the value of communication in attaining monetary policy 
objectives.33  Federal  Reserve  officials,  like  those  at  other  central  banks,  had  traditionally 
been  highly  guarded  in  their  public  pronouncements.  They  believed,  for  example,  that  the 
ability to take markets by surprise was important for influencing financial conditions.34 Thus, 
although  Fed  policymakers  of  the  1980s  and  early  1990s  had  become  somewhat  more 
explicit  about  policy  objectives  and  strategy,  the  same  degree  of  transparency  was  not 
                                                
29  For discussion of these points, see Meltzer (2009b). 
30  See, for example, Axilrod (1982). 
31  Central banks’ emphasis on expectations management partly reflected lessons from the rational expectations 
literature of the 1970s. Monetary policy implications of the rational expectations literature were further clarified 
by  later  research.  For  example,  Sargent  (1982)  brought  out  dramatically  the  dependence  of  inflation 
expectations  on  the  monetary  policy  regime  in  his  study  of  major  disinflations,  while  rational  expectations 
models were extended to include sticky prices (Fischer, 1977; Taylor, 1980; Rotemberg, 1982; Calvo, 1983) 
and interest rate rules (Sargent and Wallace, 1975; McCallum, 1981; Taylor, 1993, 1999b; Woodford, 2003). 
32  See Lindsey, Orphanides, and Rasche (2005). 
33  See Woodford (2005). Many of these principles were codified in the emerging doctrine of inflation targeting, 
the  practice  of  which  was  greatly  advanced  by  central  banks  in  other  countries.  One  of  the  most  notable 
examples is New Zealand’s introduction of inflation targeting in 1990. 
34  See, for example, Goodfriend (1986) and Cukierman and Meltzer (1986).

the  public  accountability  of 
forthcoming  on  monetary  policy  decisions  and  operations.35  The  release  of  a  postmeeting 
statement  by  the  FOMC,  a  practice  that  began  in  1994,  was,  therefore,  an  important 
watershed.  Over  time,  the  statement  was  expanded  to  include  more  detailed  information 
about the reason for the policy decision and an indication of the balance of risks.36  
In  addition  to  improving  the  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy,  these  developments  in 
communications  also  enhanced 
the  Federal  Reserve. 
Accountability  is,  of  course,  essential for  policy  independence  in  a  democracy.  During this 
period, economists found considerable evidence that central banks that are afforded policy 
independence  in  the  pursuit  of  their  mandated  objectives  deliver  better  economic 
outcomes.37  
One cannot look back at the Great Moderation today without asking whether the sustained 
economic stability of the period somehow promoted the excessive risk-taking that followed. 
The idea that this long period of calm lulled investors, financial firms, and financial regulators 
into paying insufficient attention to building risks must have some truth in it. I don’t think we 
should conclude, though, that we therefore should not strive to achieve  economic stability. 
Rather, the right conclusion is that, even in (or perhaps, especially in) stable and prosperous 
times, monetary policymakers and financial regulators should regard safeguarding financial 
stability to be of equal importance as – indeed, a necessary prerequisite for – maintaining 
macroeconomic stability.  
Macroeconomists  and  historians  will  continue  to  debate  the  sources  of  the  remarkable 
economic performance during the Great Moderation.38 My own view is that the improvements 
in  the  monetary  policy  framework  and  in  monetary  policy  communication,  including,  of 
course, the better management of inflation and the anchoring of inflation expectations, were 
important  reasons for that  strong  performance. However,  we  have  learned  in  recent  years 
that while well-managed monetary policy may be necessary for economic stability, it is not 
sufficient.  
The financial crisis, the Great Recession, and today 
It has been about six years since the first signs of the financial crisis appeared in the United 
States,  and  we  are  still  working  to  achieve  a  full  recovery  from  its  effects.  What  lessons 
should we take for the future from this experience, particularly in the context of a century of 
Federal Reserve history?  
The  financial  crisis  and  the  ensuing  Great  Recession  reminded  us  of  a  lesson  that  we 
learned both in the 19th century and during the Depression but had forgotten to some extent, 
which is that severe financial instability can do grave damage to the broader economy. The 
implication is that a central bank must take into account risks to financial stability if it is to 
help  achieve  good  macroeconomic  performance.  Today,  the  Federal  Reserve  sees  its 
responsibilities for the maintenance of financial stability as coequal with its responsibilities for 
the management of monetary policy, and we have made substantial institutional changes in 
recognition of this change in goals. In a sense, we have come full circle, back to the original 
goal of the Federal Reserve of preventing financial panics.39

How  should  a  central  bank  enhance  financial  stability?  One  means  is  by  assuming  the 
lender-of-last-resort function that Bagehot understood and described 140 years ago, under 
which the central bank uses its power to provide liquidity to ease market conditions during 
periods of panic or incipient panic. The Fed’s many liquidity programs played a central role in 
containing the crisis of 2008 to 2009. However, putting out the fire is not enough; it is also 
important to foster a financial system that is sufficiently resilient to withstand large financial 
shocks. Toward that end, the Federal Reserve, together with other regulatory agencies and 
the  Financial  Stability  Oversight  Council,  is  actively  engaged  in  monitoring  financial 
developments and working to strengthen financial institutions and markets. The reliance on 
stronger regulation is informed by the success of New Deal regulatory reforms, but current 
reform efforts go even further by working to identify and defuse risks not only to individual 
firms  but  to  the  financial  system  as  a  whole,  an  approach  known  as  macroprudential 
regulation.  
Financial  stability  is  also  linked  to  monetary  policy,  though  these  links  are  not  yet  fully 
understood.  Here  the  Fed’s  evolving  strategy  is  to  make  monitoring,  supervision,  and 
regulation  the  first  line  of  defense  against  systemic  risks;  to  the  extent  that  risks  remain, 
however, the FOMC strives to incorporate these risks in the cost-benefit analysis applied to 
all monetary policy actions.40  
What  about  the  monetary  policy  framework?  In  general,  the  Federal  Reserve’s  policy 
framework  inherits many  of the  elements  put  in place  during  the Great Moderation.  These 
features include the emphasis on preserving the Fed’s inflation credibility, which is critical for 
anchoring  inflation  expectations,  and  a  balanced  approach  in  pursuing  both  parts  of  the 
Fed’s  dual  mandate  in  the  medium  term.  We  have  also  continued  to  increase  the 
transparency of monetary policy. For example, the Committee’s communications framework 
now  includes  a  statement  of  its  longer-run  goals  and  monetary  policy  strategy.41  In  that 
statement,  the  Committee  indicated  that  it  judged  that  inflation  at  a  rate  of  2  percent  (as 
measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures) is 
most consistent over the longer run with the FOMC’s dual mandate. FOMC participants also 
regularly provide estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment; those estimates 
currently  have  a  central  tendency  of  5.2  to  6.0  percent.  By  helping  to  anchor  longer-term 
expectations,  this  transparency  gives  the  Federal  Reserve  greater  flexibility  to  respond  to 
short-run developments. This framework, which combines short-run policy flexibility with the 
discipline  provided  by  the  announced  targets,  has  been  described  as  constrained 
discretion.42  Other  communication  innovations  include  early  publication  of  the  minutes  of 
FOMC meetings and quarterly postmeeting press conferences by the Chairman.  
The  framework  for  implementing  monetary  policy  has  evolved  further  in  recent  years, 
reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment. Notably, 
following the ideas of Lars Svensson and others, the FOMC has moved toward a framework 
that  ties  policy  settings  more  directly  to  the  economic  outlook,  a  so-called  forecast-based 
approach.43  In  particular,  the  FOMC  has  released  more  detailed  statements  following  its 
meetings that have related the outlook for policy to prospective economic developments and 
has  introduced  regular  summaries  of  the  individual  economic  projections  of  FOMC 
participants  (including  for  the  target  federal  funds  rate).  The  provision  of  additional 
                                                
40  See Bernanke (2002). 
41  The statement can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm. 
42  See Bernanke and Mishkin (1997). 
43  In a forecast-based approach, monetary policymakers inform the public of their medium-term targets- – say, a 
specific  value  for  the  inflation  rate  –  and  attempt  to  vary  the  instruments  of  policy  as  needed  to  meet  that 
target over  time.  In  contrast, an  instrument-based approach  involves  providing  the  public  information  about 
how the monetary policy committee plans to vary its policy instrument – typically, a short-term interest rate, 
like the federal funds rate – in response to economic conditions. See Svensson (2003).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
information about policy plans has helped Fed policymakers deal with the constraint posed 
by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates; in particular, by offering guidance 
about how policy will respond to economic developments, the Committee has been able to 
increase  policy  accommodation,  even  when  the  short-term  interest  rate  is  near  zero  and 
cannot  be  meaningfully  reduced  further.44  The  Committee  has  also  sought  to  influence 
interest rates further out on the yield curve, notably through its securities purchases. Other 
central  banks  in  advanced  economies,  also  confronted  with  the  effective  lower  bound  on 
short-term interest rates, have taken similar measures.  
In short, the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our monetary policy 
and financial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two. We have made progress on 
both  counts,  but  more  needs  to  be  done.  In  particular,  the  complementarities  among 
regulatory  and  supervisory  policies  (including  macroprudential  policy),  lender-of-last-resort 
policy, and standard monetary policy are increasingly evident. Both research and experience 
are needed to help the Fed and other central banks develop comprehensive frameworks that 
incorporate all of these elements. The broader conclusion is what might be described as the 
overriding lesson of the Federal Reserve’s history: that central banking doctrine and practice 
are never static. We and other central banks around the world will have to continue to work 
hard to adapt to events, new ideas, and changes in the economic and financial environment.
