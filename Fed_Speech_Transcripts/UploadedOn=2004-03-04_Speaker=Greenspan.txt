Alan Greenspan: Economic outlook and current fiscal issues Testimony by Mr Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System before the Committee on the Budget  US House of Representatives  25 February 2004. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee  I am pleased to be here today and to offer my views on the outlook for the economy and current fiscal issues. I want to emphasize that I speak for myself and not necessarily for the Federal Reserve. As you know  the U.S. economy appears to have made the transition from a period of subpar growth to one of more vigorous expansion. Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose briskly in the second half of last year  fueled by a sizable increase in household spending  a notable strengthening in business investment  and a sharp rebound in exports. Moreover  productivity surged  prices remained stable  and financial conditions improved further. Overall  the economy has lately made impressive gains in output and real incomes  although progress in creating jobs has been limited. The most recent indicators suggest that the economy is off to a strong start in 2004  and prospects for sustaining the expansion in the period ahead are good. The marked improvement in the financial situations of many households and businesses in recent years should bolster aggregate demand. And with short-term real interest rates close to zero  monetary policy remains highly accommodative. Also  the impetus from fiscal policy appears likely to stay expansionary through this year. At the same time  increases in efficiency and a significant level of underutilized resources should help keep a lid on inflation. This favorable short-term outlook for the U.S. economy  however  is playing out against a backdrop of growing concern about the prospects for the federal budget. As you are well aware  after having run surpluses for a brief period around the turn of the decade  the federal budget has reverted to deficit. The unified deficit swelled to $375 billion in fiscal 2003 and appears to be continuing to widen in the current fiscal year. According to the latest projections from the Administration and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)  if current policies remain in place  the budget will stay in deficit for some time. In part  the recent deficits have resulted from the economic downturn in 2001 and the period of slow growth that followed  as well as the sharp declines in equity prices. The deficits also reflect a significant step-up in spending on defense and higher outlays for homeland security and many other nondefense discretionary programs. Tax reductions - some of which were intended specifically to provide stimulus to the economy - also contributed to the deterioration of the fiscal balance. For a time  the fiscal stimulus associated with the larger deficits was helpful in shoring up a weak economy. During the next few years  these deficits will tend to narrow somewhat as the economic expansion proceeds and rising incomes generate increases in revenues. Moreover  the current ramp-up in defense spending will not continue indefinitely. Merely maintaining a given military commitment  rather than adding to it  will remove an important factor driving the deficit higher. But the ratio of federal debt held by the public to GDP has already stopped falling and has even edged up in the past couple of years - implying a worsening of the starting point from which policymakers will have to address the adverse budgetary implications of an aging population and rising health care costs. For about a decade  the rules laid out in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990  and the later modifications and extensions of the act  provided a procedural framework that helped the Congress make the difficult decisions that were required to forge a better fiscal balance. However  the brief emergence of surpluses eroded the will to adhere to those rules  and many of the provisions that helped to restrain budgetary decisionmaking in the 1990s - in particular  the limits on discretionary spending and the PAYGO requirements - were violated more and more frequently and eventually allowed to expire. In recent years  budget debates have turned to choices offered by those advocating tax cuts and those advocating increased spending. To date  actions that would lower forthcoming deficits have received only narrow support  and many analysts are becoming increasingly concerned that  without a restoration of the budget enforcement mechanisms and the fundamental political will they signal  the inbuilt political bias in favor of red ink will once again become entrenched. In 2008 - just four years from now - the first cohort of the baby-boom generation will reach 62  the earliest age at which Social Security retirement benefits may be claimed and the age at which about half of prospective beneficiaries choose to retire; in 2011  these individuals will reach 65 and will thus BIS Review 13/2004 1 be eligible for Medicare. At that time  under the intermediate assumptions of the OASDI trustees  there will still be more than three covered workers for each OASDI beneficiary; by 2025  this ratio is projected to be down to 2-1/4. This dramatic demographic change is certain to place enormous demands on our nation’s resources - demands we almost surely will be unable to meet unless action is taken. For a variety of reasons  that action is better taken as soon as possible. The budget scenarios considered by the CBO in its December assessment of the long-term budget outlook offer a vivid - and sobering - illustration of the challenges we face as we prepare for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. These scenarios suggest that  under a range of reasonably plausible assumptions about spending and taxes  we could be in a situation in the decades ahead in which rapid increases in the unified budget deficit set in motion a dynamic in which large deficits result in ever-growing interest payments that augment deficits in future years. The resulting rise in the federal debt could drain funds away from private capital formation and thus over time slow the growth of living standards. Favorable productivity developments  of course  can help to alleviate the impending budgetary strains  but no one should expect productivity growth to be sufficient to bail us out. Indeed  productivity would have to grow at a rate far above its historical average to fully resolve the long-term financing problems of Social Security and Medicare. Higher productivity  of course  buoys expected revenues to the system  but it also raises Social Security obligations.1 Moreover  although productivity has no direct link to Medicare spending  historical experience suggests that the demand for medical services increases with real income  which over time rises in line with productivity. Today  federal outlays under Social Security and Medicare amount to less than 7 percent of GDP. In December  the CBO projected that these outlays would increase to 12 percent of GDP by 2030 under current law  using assumptions about the growth of health-care costs similar to the intermediate assumptions of the Medicare trustees; when spending on Medicaid is added in  the rise in the ratio is even steeper. To be sure  the rise in these outlays relative to GDP could be financed by tax increases  but the CBO results suggest that  even if other non-interest spending is constrained fairly tightly  ensuring fiscal stability would require an overall federal tax burden well above its long-term average. Most experts believe that the best baseline for planning purposes is to assume that the demographic shift associated with the retirement of the baby-boom generation will be permanent - that is  it will not reverse when that cohort passes away. Indeed  so long as longevity continues to increase - and assuming no significant changes in immigration or fertility rates - the proportion of elderly in the population will only rise. If this fundamental change in the age distribution materializes  we will eventually have no choice but to make significant structural adjustments in the major retirement programs. One change the Congress could consider as it moves forward on this critical issue is to replace the current measure of the “cost of living” that is used for many purposes with respect to both revenues and outlays with a more appropriate price index. As you may be aware  in 2002  the Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a new price index - the chained consumer price index (CPI). The new index is based on the same underlying individual prices as is the official CPI. But it combines those prices so as to remove some of the inadvertent bias in the official price index  and thus it better measures changes in the cost of living  the statutory intent of the indexing.2 All else being equal  had a chained CPI been used for indexing over the past decade  the cumulative unified budget deficit and thus the level of the federal debt would have been reduced about $200 billion; higher receipts and the reduction in debt service associated with those higher receipts account for roughly 60 percent of the saving  with the remainder attributable to lower outlays. Shifting to the chain-weighted measure would not address perhaps more fundamental shortcomings in the CPI - most notably the question of whether quality improvement is adequately captured - but it would be an important step toward better implementation of the intention of the Congress. 1 Under current law  faster productivity growth would not affect individuals who are already retired because their benefits are indexed by the consumer price index (CPI). However  it would raise initial benefits for future retirees through its effect on real wages over time. In the end  productivity would have to rise about 3-1/2 percent per year  about 2 percentage points per year faster than the trustees’ current intermediate assumption  to eliminate the Social Security imbalance over seventy-five years; productivity growth would have to be even more rapid to achieve balance in perpetuity. In particular  the chained CPI captures more fully than does the official CPI the way that consumers alter the mix of their expenditures in response to changes in relative prices. 2 2 BIS Review 13/2004 Another possible adjustment relates to the age at which Social Security and Medicare benefits will be provided. Under current law  and even with the so-called normal retirement age for Social Security slated to move up to 67 over the next two decades  the ratio of the number of years that the typical worker will spend in retirement to the number of years he or she works will rise in the long term. A critical step forward would be to adjust the system so that this ratio stabilizes. A number of specific approaches have been proposed for implementing this indexation  but the principle behind all of them is to insulate the finances of the system  at least to a degree  from further changes in life expectancy. Sound private and public decisionmaking will be aided by determining ahead of the fact how one source of risk  namely demographic developments  will be dealt with. The degree of uncertainty about whether future resources will be adequate to meet our current statutory obligations to the coming generations of retirees is daunting. The concern is not so much about Social Security  where benefits are tied in a mechanical fashion to retirees’ wage histories and we have some useful tools for forecasting future outlays. The outlook for Medicare  however  is much more difficult to assess. Although forecasting the number of program beneficiaries is reasonably straightforward  we know very little about how rapidly medical technology will continue to advance and how those innovations will translate into future spending. To be sure  technological innovations can greatly improve the quality of medical care and can  in theory  reduce the costs of existing treatments. But because medical technology expands the range of treatment options  it also has the potential of adding to overall spending - in some cases  significantly. As a result  the range of possible outlays per recipient is extremely wide. This uncertainty is an important reason to be cautious - especially given that government programs  whether for spending or for tax preferences  are easy to initiate but can be extraordinarily difficult to shut down once constituencies for them develop. In view of this upward ratchet in government programs and the enormous uncertainty about the upper bounds of future demands for medical care  I believe that a thorough review of our spending commitments - and at least some adjustment in those commitments - is necessary for prudent policy. I also believe that we have an obligation to those in and near retirement to honor what has been promised to them. If changes need to be made  they should be made soon enough so that future retirees have time to adjust their plans for retirement spending and to make sure that their personal resources  along with what they expect to receive from the government  will be sufficient to meet their retirement needs. I certainly agree that the same scrutiny needs to be applied to taxes. However  tax rate increases of sufficient dimension to deal with our looming fiscal problems arguably pose significant risks to economic growth and the revenue base. The exact magnitude of such risks is very difficult to estimate  but they are of enough concern  in my judgment  to warrant aiming to close the fiscal gap primarily  if not wholly  from the outlay side. The dimension of the challenge is enormous. The one certainty is that the resolution of this situation will require difficult choices and that the future performance of the economy will depend on those choices. No changes will be easy  as they all will involve lowering claims on resources or raising financial obligations. It falls on the Congress to determine how best to address the competing claims. In doing so  you will need to consider not only the distributional effects of policy change but also the broader economic effects on labor supply  retirement behavior  and private saving. History has shown that  when faced with major challenges  elected officials have risen to the occasion. In particular  over the past twenty years or so  the prospect of large deficits has generally led to actions to narrow them. I trust that the recent deterioration in the budget outlook and the fast- approaching retirement of the baby-boom generation will be met with similar determination and effectiveness.
