Ben S Bernanke: Order of the Palmetto Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the presentation of the Order of the Palmetto  Dillon  South Carolina  1 September 2006. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to come back to Dillon and very grateful for the honor you have done me today. Thank you all very much for your thoughtfulness and your efforts to prepare for this event. It is good to see so many people that I remember  as well as their children and maybe even a few grandchildren. My family’s connection with Dillon goes back about sixty years. My grandfather Jonas Bernanke and his wife  Lina  moved here in the 1940s when Jonas purchased a local drugstore. Jonas named the store with his own initials - hence Jay Bee Drugs. Jonas’s sons - my dad and my uncle - bought the store from their father and ran it as partners for many years. The original store was on Main Street  but when the chain stores entered the local market  my dad and uncle built a new  larger  and more modern store a block off Main. They competed by offering personal  first-name service  by delivering prescriptions without charge  and by coming down to the store at any time  nights or Sundays  to fill an emergency prescription. Dillon had very few doctors at the time  and lots of people came to my dad and uncle for advice on basic health matters. My mother  who gave up a job teaching elementary school when I was born  often helped out in the store. As a child  I was supposed to help out as well  but I usually ended up in the store’s comic book section. Our family moved to Dillon when I was very small  and all my childhood memories are here. I went to East Elementary  J.V. Martin Junior High  and Dillon High School. Quite a few friends were classmates for all twelve grades. I made many other friends playing saxophone in the high-school marching band. My family and I attended Dillon’s small synagogue  Ohav Shalom  which is unfortunately no longer in existence. As a teenager  like many other teenagers  I itched to get away from the small town in which I was raised to see the bright lights of the big city. I got my wish  leaving when I was seventeen to attend college and graduate school in Boston. I met my wife in Boston  and we have lived in Palo Alto  California; Princeton  New Jersey; and now Washington. We have two children  a son and a daughter  now in graduate school and college  respectively. My wife is a teacher and is meeting her classes today in a public charter high school in Washington. Although the idea of leaving Dillon to attend college was exciting for me  I realize now that I learned a lot from living here for seventeen years. I learned  among many other lessons  a few things about work. I saw the long hours and persistent effort my parents put in to make their independent small business successful. After I graduated from high school I spent the summer as a construction worker helping to build Dillon’s Saint Eugene hospital  and during the summers of my college years  I waited tables six days a week at the South of the Border. I took two lessons from those experiences: First  in small towns like Dillon and in communities all across the United States  people work very hard every day to support themselves and their families. I remember that  on the first day I came home from the construction site that summer  I was too tired to eat and I fell asleep in my chair. The second thing I learned in Dillon is that Americans are economically ambitious; they seek opportunity and advancement. I remember the fellow construction worker who wanted to become foreman someday and a waitress who was saving to go to college. I was impressed by these experiences  and I think they were an important reason I went into economics  which a great economist once called the study of people in the ordinary business of life. Now I am an economic policy maker  and I sit in a nice office in Washington looking at reports and tables of data and following the fluctuations of the financial markets. However  I try not to forget what underlies all those data: millions of Americans working hard  trying to better themselves economically  struggling to manage their family finances  and worrying about the price of gas and college tuition. I take my work extremely seriously because I know that  if my colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I do our jobs right  we will help our economy prosper and give more people the economic opportunities they seek. Let me thank you all again for inviting me back to Dillon and for sharing this morning with me. BIS Review 80/2006 1
