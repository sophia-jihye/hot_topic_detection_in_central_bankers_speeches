TITLE=Mr. Greenspan offers some considerations as a guide for government decisions on regulating the financial markets (Central Bank Articles and Speeches  21 Feb 97)
SHORT_INFO=Remarks by Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the Financial Markets Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta held in Coral Gables  Florida on 21/2/97.

Mr. Greenspan offers some considerations as a guide for government decisions on regulating the financial markets Remarks by Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  Mr. Alan Greenspan  at the Financial Markets I am pleased to participate once again in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s annual Financial Markets Conference. As in previous years  the Reserve Bank has developed a conference program that is quite timely. Changes in technology have permitted the development in recent years of increasingly diverse financial instruments and intensely competitive market structures. The rapid evolution of products and markets has led many to conclude that market regulatory structures  many of which were established in the 1920s and 1930s  have become increasingly outdated. Some see new products and markets not covered by government regulation and fear the consequences of so-called “regulatory gaps.” Others see old government regulations applied to new instruments and markets and fear the unintended consequences of what seems unnecessary and burdensome regulation. Nowhere have these tensions been more evident than in the ongoing debate over the appropriate government regulation of derivative contracts  a debate which has varied in intensity but has never fully subsided for at least ten years. Recent efforts by members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to clarify and rationalize the regulation of derivative contracts under the Commodity Exchange Act have once again placed these contentious issues on the front burner. In my remarks today I shall proffer a set of considerations that I find quite valuable as a guide to decisions about the need for government regulation of financial markets. I shall then review the history of government regulation of derivative contracts and markets in the United States and consider the current regulatory structure for those products and markets in light of these considerations. Market Regulation I would argue that the first imperative when evaluating market regulation is to enunciate clearly the public policy objectives that government regulation would be intended to promote. What market characteristics do policymakers seek to encourage? Efficiency? Fair and open access? What phenomena do we wish to discourage or eliminate? Fraud  manipulation  or other unfair practices? Systemic instability? Without explicit answers to these questions  government regulation is unlikely to be effective. More likely  it will prove unnecessary  burdensome  and perhaps even contrary to what more careful consideration would reveal to be the underlying objectives. A second imperative  once public policy objectives are clearly specified  is to evaluate whether government regulation is necessary for those purposes. In making such evaluations  it is critically important to recognize that no market is ever truly unregulated. The self-interest of market participants generates private market regulation. Thus  the real question is not whether a market should be regulated. Rather  the real question is whether government intervention strengthens or weakens private regulation. If incentives for private market regulation are weak or if market participants lack the capabilities to pursue their interests effectively  then the introduction of government regulation may improve regulation. But if private market regulation is effective  then government regulation is at best unnecessary. At worst  the introduction of government regulation may actually weaken the effectiveness of regulation if government regulation is itself ineffective or undermines incentives for private market regulation. We must be aware that government regulation unavoidably involves some BIS Review 19/1997 - 2 - element of moral hazard -- if private market participants believe that government is protecting their interests  their own efforts to protect their interests will diminish to some degree. Whether government regulation is needed  and if so  what form of government regulation is optimal  depends critically on a market’s characteristics. A “one-size-fits-all” approach to financial market regulation is almost never appropriate. The degree and type of government regulation needed  if any  depends on the types of instruments traded  the types of market participants  and the nature of the relationships among market participants. To cite just one example  a government regulatory framework designed to protect retail investors from fraud or insolvency of brokers is unlikely to be necessary -- and is almost sure to be suboptimal -- if applied to a market in which large institutions transact on a principal-to-principal basis. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is seldom appropriate  it may be useful to offer transactors a choice between seeking the benefits and accepting the burdens of government regulation  or forgoing those benefits and avoiding those burdens by transacting in financial markets that are only privately regulated. In such circumstances  the privately regulated markets in effect provide a market test of the net benefits of government regulation. Migration of activity from government-regulated to privately regulated markets sends a signal to government regulators that many transactors believe the costs of regulation exceed the benefits. When such migration occurs  government regulators should consider carefully whether less regulation or different regulation would provide a better cost-benefit tradeoff without compromising public policy objectives. Historical Development of U.S. Government Regulation of Derivative Markets Before evaluating the current regulation of derivatives in light of these considerations  it is quite useful to know something of the history of these instruments and their regulation. Derivative contracts (forward contracts and options) appear to have been utilized throughout American history. Indeed  it will probably come as a surprise even to this audience that 15 to 25 percent of trades on the New York Stock Exchange in its early years were time bargains  that is  forward contracts  rather than transactions for cash settlement (in those days  same-day settlement) or regular-way settlement (next-day settlement). In the case of commodities  forward contracts for corn  wheat  and other grains came into common use by 1850 in Chicago  where they were known as “to arrive” contracts. The first organized futures exchange in the United States  the Chicago Board of Trade  evolved through the progressive standardization of the terms of “to arrive” contracts  including lot sizes  grades of grain  and delivery periods. Trading apparently was centralized on the Board of Trade by 1859  and in 1865 it set out detailed rules for the trading of highly standardized contracts quite similar to the grain futures contracts traded today. The first recorded instance of federal government regulation of derivatives was the Anti-Gold Futures Act of 1864  which prohibited the trading of gold futures. The government had been unhappy that its fiat currency issues  the infamous greenbacks  were at that time trading at a substantial discount to gold. Unwilling to accept this result as evidence of failure of the government’s monetary policies  Congress concluded that it was evidence of a serious failure of private market regulation. In the event  Congress’s action was followed by a further sharp drop in the value of the greenbacks. Although it took the government many years to restore monetary policy to a sound footing  it took Congress only two weeks to conclude that its prohibition of gold futures was having unintended consequences and to repeal the act. BIS Review 19/1997 - 3 - It has been the trading of agricultural futures  however  that from its inception has produced calls for government intervention. Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries  farmers were often opposed to futures trading  particularly during periods when prices of their products were low or declining. They presumed that dreaded speculators were depressing their prices. The states were the first to respond to calls for government regulation of futures. For the most part  state legislation on futures was limited to prohibitions on bucket shops  that is  operations that purport to act as brokers of exchange-traded futures but “bucket” rather than execute their clients’ trades. An Illinois statute of 1874 signaled early concerns about market integrity. The statute criminalized the spreading of false rumors to influence commodity prices and attempts to corner commodity markets. After its misadventure with futures regulation during the Civil War  the federal government appears not to have given further consideration to regulating futures trading until 1883  when a bill was introduced in Congress to prohibit use of the mails to market futures. Thereafter  repeated efforts were made to regulate or prohibit trading of futures and options on agricultural products. When the Agriculture Department reviewed the Congressional Record in 1920  it found that 164 measures of this sort had previously been introduced. These efforts culminated in passage of the Futures Trading Act of 1921. That act was promptly declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court  on the grounds that it was a regulatory measure masquerading as a tax measure. But in 1922 Congress restated the purpose of the 1921 act as “an act for the prevention and removal of obstructions and burdens upon interstate commerce in grain  by regulating transactions on grain futures exchanges ” and renamed it the Grain Futures Act of 1922. As an explicitly regulatory measure  it was later upheld by the Court. The objective of the Grain Futures Act was to reduce or eliminate “sudden or unreasonable fluctuations” in the prices of grain on futures exchanges. The framers of the act believed that such sudden or unreasonable fluctuations of grain futures prices reflected their susceptibility to “speculation  manipulation  or control.” Moreover  such fluctuations in price were seen to have broad ramifications that affected the national public interest. Grain futures contracts were widely used by producers and distributors of grain to hedge the risks of price fluctuations. Futures prices also were widely disseminated and widely used as the basis for pricing grain transactions off the futures exchanges. Indeed  given the relative size of the agricultural sector of the time  fluctuations in futures prices no doubt had the potential to affect the economy as a whole. It is not entirely clear that the view that futures trading was exacerbating volatility in agricultural prices was well-founded. To be sure  evidence abounds that market participants talked incessantly about corners and bear raids. Moreover  the design of the contracts may  indeed  have made such contracts susceptible to manipulation. However  empirical studies of more recent experience cast doubt on whether the use of derivatives adds to price volatility. And  while charges of market manipulation are heard to this day  they typically are difficult  if not impossible  to prove. Professional speculators were easy to blame for fluctuations in market prices that actually reflected fundamental shifts in supply or demand  as they are today. The market clearing process is a very abstract concept. It is sometimes far easier to envisage price changes as the consequence of individual manipulators. Indeed  for a lot of nineteenth-century ring traders  it was some measure of manhood (women were few) that they could squeeze or corner a market. The evidence suggests that this was largely Walter Middy-type fantasy. In any event  the Grain Futures Act of 1922 established many of the key elements of our current regulatory framework for derivatives. In general  the act was designed to confine futures trading to regulated futures exchanges. The act made it unlawful to trade futures on BIS Review 19/1997 - 4 - exchanges other than those designated as contract markets by the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary was permitted to so designate an exchange only if certain conditions were met. These included the establishment of procedures for recordkeeping and reporting of futures transactions  for prevention of dissemination of false or misleading crop or market information  and for prevention of price manipulation or cornering of markets. Finally  the act recognized the need to permit bona fide derivatives transactions to be executed off of the regulated exchanges; it explicitly excluded forward contracts for the delivery of grain from the exchange-trading requirement. Forward contracts were essentially defined as contracts for future delivery to which farmers or farm interests were counterparties or in which the seller  if not a farmer  owned the grain at the time of making the contract. The next major piece of federal legislation affecting futures regulation was the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) of 1936. As in the case of the Grain Futures Act  an important objective of the CEA was to discourage forms of speculation that were seen as exacerbating price volatility. In addition  the CEA introduced provisions designed primarily to protect small investors in commodity futures  whose participation had been increasing and was viewed as beneficial. These provisions included requirements for the registration of futures commission merchants (FCMs)  that is  futures brokers  and for the segregation of customer funds from FCM funds. The CEA also expanded the coverage of futures regulation to cover contracts for cotton  rice  and certain other specifically enumerated commodities traded on futures exchanges  and prohibited the trading of options on commodities traded on futures exchanges. The federal regulatory framework for derivatives market regulation then remained substantially unchanged until 1974  when Congress enacted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act. The act did not make any fundamental changes in the objectives of derivatives regulation. However  it expanded the scope of the CEA quite significantly. In addition to creating the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as an independent agency and giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over commodity futures and options  the 1974 amendments expanded the CEA’s definition of “commodity” beyond a specific list of agricultural commodities to include “all other goods and articles  except onions  . . . and all services  rights  and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in.” In one respect  this was sweeping deregulation  in that it explicitly allowed the trading on futures exchanges of contracts on virtually any underlying assets  including financial instruments. Only onion futures  banned in 1958 as the presumed favorite plaything of manipulators  remained beyond the pale. In another respect  however  this was a sweeping extension of regulation. Given this broad definition of a commodity and an equally broad interpretation of what constitutes a futures contract  this change brought a tremendous range of off-exchange transactions potentially within the scope of the CEA. In particular  it could be interpreted to extend the broad prohibition on off-exchange trading of futures to an immense volume of diverse transactions that never had been traded on exchanges. The potential for the legality of a wider range of transactions to be called into question did not go unnoticed during debate on the 1974 act. In particular  the Treasury Department proposed language excluding off-exchange derivative transactions in foreign currency  government securities  and certain other financial instruments from the newly expanded CEA. This proposal was adopted by Congress and is known as the Treasury Amendment. In proposing the amendment  Treasury was primarily concerned with protecting foreign exchange markets from what it considered unnecessary and potentially harmful regulation. The foreign exchange markets clearly have quite different characteristics from markets for agricultural futures -- the markets for the major currencies are deep and  as some central banks have learned the hard way  they are extremely difficult to manipulate. BIS Review 19/1997 - 5 - Furthermore  participants in those markets  primarily banks and other financial institutions  and large corporations  would not seem to need  and certainly are not seeking  the protection of the CEA. Thus  there was  and is  no reason to presume that the regulatory framework of the CEA needs to be applied to the foreign exchange markets to achieve the public policy objectives that motivated the CEA. Indeed  the wholesale foreign exchange markets provide a clear and compelling example of how private parties can regulate markets quite effectively without government assistance. BIS Review 19/1997
