Ben S Bernanke: Confirmation hearing Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs  US Senate  Washington DC  3 December 2009. Chairman Dodd  Senator Shelby  and members of the Committee  I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. I would also like to express my gratitude to President Obama for nominating me to a second term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and for his support for a strong and independent Federal Reserve. Finally  I thank my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System for the remarkable resourcefulness  dedication  and stamina they have demonstrated over the past two years under extremely trying conditions. They have never lost sight of the importance of the work of the Federal Reserve for the economic well-being of all Americans. Over the past two years  our nation  indeed the world  has endured the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression  a crisis which in turn triggered a sharp contraction in global economic activity. Today  most indicators suggest that financial markets are stabilizing and that the economy is emerging from the recession. Yet our task is far from complete. Far too many Americans are without jobs  and unemployment could remain high for some time even if  as we anticipate  moderate economic growth continues. The Federal Reserve remains committed to its mission to help restore prosperity and to stimulate job creation while preserving price stability. If I am confirmed  I will work to the utmost of my abilities in the pursuit of those objectives. As severe as the effects of the crisis have been  however  the outcome could have been markedly worse without the strong actions taken by the Congress  the Treasury Department  the Federal Reserve  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  and other authorities both here and abroad. For our part  the Federal Reserve cut interest rates early and aggressively  reducing our target for the federal funds rate to nearly zero. We played a central role in efforts to quell the financial turmoil  for example  through our joint efforts with other agencies and foreign authorities to avert a collapse of the global banking system last fall; by ensuring financial institutions adequate access to short-term funding when private funding sources dried up; and through our leadership of the comprehensive assessment of large U.S. banks conducted this past spring  an exercise that significantly increased public confidence in the banking system. We also created targeted lending programs that have helped to restart the flow of credit in a number of critical markets  including the commercial paper market and the market for securities backed by loans to households and small businesses. Indeed  we estimate that one of the targeted programs – the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility – has thus far helped finance 3.3 million loans to households (excluding credit card accounts)  more than 100 million credit card accounts  480 000 loans to small businesses  and 100 000 loans to larger businesses. And our purchases of longer-term securities have provided support to private credit markets and helped to reduce longer-term interest rates  such as mortgage rates. Taken together  the Federal Reserve's actions have contributed substantially to the significant improvement in financial conditions and to what now appear to be the beginnings of a turnaround in both the U.S. and foreign economies. Having acted promptly and forcefully to confront the financial crisis and its economic consequences  we are also keenly aware that  to ensure longer-term economic stability  we must be prepared to withdraw the extraordinary policy support in a smooth and timely way as markets and the economy recover. We are confident that we have the necessary tools to do so. However  as is always the case  even when the monetary policy tools employed are conventional  determining the appropriate time and pace for the withdrawal of stimulus will require careful analysis and judgment. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market BIS Review 160/2009 1 Committee and I are committed to implementing our exit strategy in a manner that both supports job creation and fosters continued price stability. A financial crisis of the severity we have experienced must prompt financial institutions and regulators alike to undertake unsparing self-assessments of their past performance. At the Federal Reserve  we have been actively engaged in identifying and implementing improvements in our regulation and supervision of financial firms. In the realm of consumer protection  during the past three years  we have comprehensively overhauled regulations aimed at ensuring fair treatment of mortgage borrowers and credit card users  among numerous other initiatives. To promote safety and soundness  we continue to work with other domestic and foreign supervisors to require stronger capital  liquidity  and risk management at banking organizations  while also taking steps to ensure that compensation packages do not provide incentives for excessive risk-taking and an undue focus on short-term results. Drawing on our experience in leading the recent comprehensive assessment of 19 of the largest U.S. banks  we are expanding and improving our cross-firm  or horizontal  reviews of large institutions  which will afford us greater insight into industry practices and possible emerging risks. To complement on-site supervisory reviews  we are also creating an enhanced quantitative surveillance program that will make use of the skills not only of supervisors  but also of economists  specialists in financial markets  and other experts within the Federal Reserve. We are requiring large firms to provide supervisors with more detailed and timely information on risk positions  operating performance  and other key indicators  and we are strengthening consolidated supervision to better capture the firmwide risks faced by complex organizations. In sum  heeding the lessons of the crisis  we are committed to taking a more proactive and comprehensive approach to oversight to ensure that emerging problems are identified early and met with prompt and effective supervisory responses. We also have renewed and strengthened our longstanding commitment to transparency and accountability. In the making of monetary policy  the Federal Reserve is highly transparent  providing detailed minutes three weeks after each policy meeting  quarterly economic projections  regular testimonies to the Congress  and much other information. Our financial statements are public and audited by an outside accounting firm  we publish our balance sheet weekly  and we provide extensive information through monthly reports and on our website on all the temporary lending facilities developed during the crisis  including the collateral that we take. Further  our financial activities are subject to review by an independent inspector general. And the Congress  through the Government Accountability Office  can and does audit all parts of operations  except for monetary policy and related areas explicitly exempted by a 1978 provision passed by the Congress. The Congress created that exemption to protect monetary policy from short-term political pressures and thereby to support our ability to effectively pursue our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In navigating through the crisis  the Federal Reserve has been greatly aided by the regional structure established by the Congress when it created the Federal Reserve in 1913. The more than 270 business people  bankers  nonprofit executives  academics  and community  agricultural  and labor leaders who serve on the boards of the 12 Reserve Banks and their 24 Branches provide valuable insights into current economic and financial conditions that statistics cannot. Thus  the structure of the Federal Reserve ensures that our policymaking is informed not just by a Washington perspective  or a Wall Street perspective  but also a Main Street perspective. If confirmed  I look forward to working closely with this Committee and the Congress to achieve fundamental reform of our system of financial regulation and stronger  more effective supervision. It would be a tragedy if  after all the hardships that Americans have endured during the past two years  our nation failed to take the steps necessary to prevent a recurrence of a crisis of the magnitude we have recently confronted. And  as we move forward  we must take care that the Federal Reserve remains effective and independent  with 2 BIS Review 160/2009 the capacity to foster financial stability and to support a return to prosperity and economic opportunity in a context of price stability. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I would be happy to respond to your questions. BIS Review 160/2009 3
