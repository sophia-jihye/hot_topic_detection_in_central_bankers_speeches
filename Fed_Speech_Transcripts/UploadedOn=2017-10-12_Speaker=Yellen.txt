Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
at 
“Prospects for Growth:  Reassessing the Fundamentals” 
59th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics 
Cleveland, Ohio 
September 26, 2017 
 I would like to thank the National Association for Business Economics for 
inviting me to speak today and for the vital role the association plays in fostering debate 
on important economic policy questions.   
Today I will discuss uncertainty and monetary policy, particularly as it relates to 
recent inflation developments.  Because changes in interest rates influence economic 
activity and inflation with a substantial lag, the Federal Open Market Committee 
(FOMC) sets monetary policy with an eye to its effects on the outlook for the economy.  
But the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty from multiple sources, and dealing 
with these uncertainties is an important feature of policymaking.  Key among current 
uncertainties are the forces driving inflation, which has remained low in recent years 
despite substantial improvement in labor market conditions.  As I will discuss, this low 
inflation likely reflects factors whose influence should fade over time.  But as I will also 
discuss, many uncertainties attend this assessment, and downward pressures on inflation 
could prove to be unexpectedly persistent.  My colleagues and I may have misjudged the 
strength of the labor market, the degree to which longer-run inflation expectations are 
consistent with our inflation objective, or even the fundamental forces driving inflation.  
In interpreting incoming data, we will need to stay alert to these possibilities and, in light 
of incoming information, adjust our views about inflation, the overall economy, and the 
stance of monetary policy best suited to promoting maximum employment and price 
stability.   
Recent Inflation Developments and the Outlook 
Let me begin by reviewing recent inflation developments and the economic 
outlook.  As the solid blue line in figure 1 indicates, inflation as measured by the price 
 - 2 - 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has generally run below the FOMC’s 
2 percent longer-run objective since that goal was announced in January 2012.1  Core 
inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has also fallen persistently 
short of 2 percent (the red dashed line).  Furthermore, both overall and core inflation, 
after moving up appreciably last year, have slipped again in recent months.  Sustained 
low inflation such as this is undesirable because, among other things, it generally leads to 
low settings of the federal funds rate in normal times, thereby providing less scope to 
ease monetary policy to fight recessions.  In addition, a persistent undershoot of our 
stated 2 percent goal could undermine the FOMC’s credibility, causing inflation 
expectations to drift and actual inflation and economic activity to become more volatile.   
As noted in its recent statement, the FOMC continues to anticipate that, with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, inflation will rise and stabilize at 
around 2 percent over the medium term.  This expectation is illustrated by the green stars, 
which represent the medians of the inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants 
at our meeting last week.  In part, this expectation reflects the significant improvement in 
labor market conditions over the past few years.  As shown in figure 2, the 
unemployment rate (the blue line) now stands at 4.4 percent, somewhat below the median 
of FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run sustainable level (the black line).  As 
the green stars indicate, labor market conditions are expected to strengthen a bit further.  
The inflation outlook also reflects the Committee’s judgment that inflation expectations 
will remain reasonably well anchored at a level consistent with PCE price inflation of 
2 percent in the long run, and that the restraint imposed in recent years by a variety of

special factors, including movements in the relative prices of food, energy, and imports, 
will wane in coming quarters.   
To understand this assessment, it is useful to decompose the forces driving 
movements in inflation since the financial crisis, as estimated using a simple model of 
inflation that I presented in a speech two years ago.2  Figure 3 reports this decomposition 
as the contributions made by various factors to the shortfall of PCE price inflation from 
2 percent, year by year.  As illustrated by the purple dotted portion of the bars, labor 
underutilization, or “slack,” accounts for a shrinking share of the shortfall since 2012 and 
is now having a negligible effect.  By comparison, the influence of changes in relative 
food, energy, and import prices--the solid blue and checkered red portions--has been 
more substantial in the past few years, although their contribution is estimated to have 
greatly diminished this year.3  
Not surprisingly, the simple model does not account for all of the year-to-year 
movements in inflation.  As indicated by the green striped portion of the bars, the residual 
component of the shortfall was modestly positive on average from 2008 through last year.  
This year, however, inflation has been unexpectedly weak from the model’s perspective.  
This unusually large error does not necessarily imply that inflation is more likely to 
                                                 
2 The simple model links the current rate of inflation to several factors, including lagged inflation, long-run 
inflation expectations, labor utilization, and changes in the relative prices of food, energy and imports 
(Yellen, 2015).  Additional details on the model can be found in the appendix.      
3 In the decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a 
result, the contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change 
relative to the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending.  The estimated contribution 
of movements in import prices is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at 
the same rate as core inflation, they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 
2 percent.  In addition, the decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to 
movements in resource utilization and other factors.  More details on the decomposition procedure can be 
found in the appendix.

continue to come in on the low side in coming years.4  Some of the recent decline in 
inflation, although not all, reflects idiosyncratic shifts in the prices of some items, such as 
the large decline in telecommunication service prices seen earlier in the year, that are 
unlikely to be repeated.  As the green dashed line in figure 4 illustrates, if the average 
change in consumer prices each month is calculated excluding items whose price changes 
are outliers on both the high and low side, the resulting “trimmed mean” measure of 
inflation shows less of a slowdown this year.5   
Based on analyses of this sort, my colleagues and I currently think that this year’s 
low inflation is probably temporary, so we continue to anticipate that inflation is likely to 
stabilize around 2 percent over the next few years.  But our understanding of the forces 
driving inflation is imperfect, and we recognize that something more persistent may be 
responsible for the current undershooting of our longer-run objective.  Accordingly, we 
will monitor incoming data closely and stand ready to modify our views based on what 
we learn.  
Uncertainty about the Inflation Outlook 
Although we judge that inflation will most likely stabilize around 2 percent over 
the next few years, the odds that it could turn out to be noticeably different are 
considerable.  This point is illustrated by figure 5.  Here the red line indicates the median 
                                                 
4 In the simple model, inflation depends in part on lagged inflation.  As a result, an unexplained movement 
in inflation is predicted to influence inflation beyond the current quarter, but to a degree that fades over 
time.  On average, the model predicts that roughly 85 percent of any unexplained movement will have 
disappeared after four quarters. 
5 In general, price changes measured over a few months tend to be noisy, even when measured on a core or 
trimmed-mean basis.  For this reason, the FOMC usually focuses on the growth rate of PCE prices over the 
previous 12 months, which smooths through the volatility in the monthly price data.  This approach also 
sidesteps distortions in the monthly data associated with residual seasonality; these distortions are likely to 
hold down month-to-month changes in prices over the balance of the year (see Peneva, 2014).  That said, 
12-month rates of inflation will continue to be held down through early 2018 by the unusually weak 
monthly readings on price changes recorded in early 2017.

of the latest inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants that I showed 
previously.  The pertinent feature of this figure is the blue shaded region around the red 
line, which shows a 70 percent confidence interval around FOMC participants’ median 
outlook.  The width of this region reflects the average accuracy of inflation projections 
made by private and government forecasters over the past 20 years.  As the figure shows, 
based on that history, there is a 30 percent probability that inflation could be greater than 
3 percent or less than 1 percent next year.6   
Most of this uncertainty reflects the influence of unexpected movements in oil 
prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as that of idiosyncratic 
developments unrelated to broader economic conditions.  These factors could easily push 
overall inflation noticeably above or below 2 percent for a time.  But such disturbances 
are not a great concern from a policy perspective because their effects fade away as long 
as inflation expectations remain anchored.7  For this reason, the FOMC strives to look 
through these transitory inflation effects when setting monetary policy.  Such was the 
case when rising oil prices pushed headline inflation noticeably above 2 percent for 
several years prior to the financial crisis.  Similarly, the Committee substantially 
discounted the reductions in inflation that occurred from 2014 through 2016 as a result of 
the decline in oil prices and the effects of the dollar’s appreciation on import prices. 
A more important issue from a policy standpoint is that some key assumptions 
underlying the baseline outlook could be wrong in ways that imply that inflation will 
remain low for longer than currently projected.  For example, labor market conditions 
                                                 
6 See Reifschneider and Tulip (2017) for details on the calculation of these confidence intervals. 
7 This statement abstracts from any persistent effects such disturbances might have on real activity, which 
could have implications for monetary policy.

may not be as tight as they appear to be, and thus they may exert less upward pressure on 
inflation than anticipated.  Alternatively, long-run inflation expectations, which have an 
important influence on actual inflation, may not be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent 
goal.  More broadly, the conventional framework for understanding inflation dynamics 
could be misspecified in some fundamental way.  Let’s now consider each of these 
possibilities in turn.   
Resource Utilization 
The unemployment rate consistent with long-run price stability at any time is not 
known with certainty; we can only estimate it.  The median of the longer-run 
unemployment rate projections submitted by FOMC participants last week is around 
4-1/2 percent.  But the long-run sustainable unemployment rate can drift over time 
because of demographic changes and other factors, some of which can be difficult to 
quantify--or even identify--in real time.8  For these and other reasons, the statistical 
precision of such estimates is limited, and the actual value of the sustainable rate could 
well be noticeably lower than currently projected.9  Thus, although FOMC participants 
generally view current labor utilization as probably somewhat greater than what can be 
sustained in the longer run, the statistical evidence from past experience does not rule out 
                                                 
8 For example, Aaronson and others (2015) estimate that increases in the average age and educational 
attainment of U.S. workers will reduce the sustainable rate of unemployment almost 1/2 percentage point 
between 2014 and 2020.  Barnichon and Mesters (2017) also present evidence that demographic changes 
have somewhat reduced the structural unemployment rate in the United States in recent years.  Relatedly, 
Yoon, Kim, and Lee (2014) and Juselius and Takats (2015) estimate that ongoing demographic transitions 
are having modest disinflationary effects in the United States and other developed economies. 
9 The statistical evidence also suggests that the sustainable rate of unemployment could be higher.  As 
illustrated by the results reported in Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) and Barnichon and 
Matthes (2017), standard errors for estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment are typically at least 
1/2 percentage point.  Accordingly, if the sustainable rate is estimated to be about 4-1/2 percent, there is 
roughly a 15 percent probability that the actual value is less than 4 percent; symmetrically, there is a 
15 percent probability that it is greater than 5 percent.

the possibility that some slack still remains in the labor market.  If so, the economy could 
sustain a higher level of employment and output in the longer run than now anticipated--a 
very beneficial outcome, albeit one that would require recalibrating monetary policy over 
time in order to reap those benefits and compensate for the accompanying reduction in 
inflationary pressures. 
A related question is whether the unemployment rate alone is an adequate gauge 
of economic slack for the purposes of explaining inflation.  Although the unemployment 
rate is probably the best single summary measure of labor utilization, some indicators 
have shown less improvement since the financial crisis.10  As the solid blue line in figure 
6 illustrates, the employed share of the “prime-age worker” population--that is, persons 
from ages 25 to 54--remains noticeably below the 2007 level.11  But employment rates 
for this group may now be permanently lower than in the past as a result of declining 
employment opportunities for less-skilled workers, a rising number of people receiving 
disability insurance, and other worrisome trends.12  Similarly, although the share of part-
time workers who would like a full-time job is still somewhat above where it stood 
                                                 
10 Several years ago, I discussed the interpretation of a wide range of labor market indicators at length 
(Yellen, 2014). 
11 The employment-to-population ratio for all persons aged 16 and over has recovered much less than the 
prime-age ratio since 2007, in large part reflecting the ongoing retirement of the baby boomers and a rise in 
school attendance rates for young adults aged 20 to 24 (Aaronson and others, 2014).  Schanzenbach and 
others (2017) estimate that the substantial overall employment-to-population gap that opened up in the 
wake of the financial crisis finally closed in July 2017. 
12 The labor force participation rate for prime-age men has been declining for decades.  Evidence suggests 
that a portion of the decline is attributable to a reduction in the demand for low-skilled workers resulting 
from advances in technology and globalization.  For a general discussion of the decline in male labor force 
participation, see Aaronson and others (2014).  For a discussion of the role played by technical factors in 
this decline, see Deming (forthcoming) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011); for a discussion of the role of 
globalization, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016).  In addition to these 
factors, Autor and Duggan (2003) and French and Song (2014) present evidence suggesting that increases 
in the number of people on disability rolls have also been important.  Relatedly, an alarming deterioration 
in health outcomes among low-education workers, including a rise in deaths related to alcohol, drugs, and 
suicide, may be having an adverse effect on both male and female employment (Case and Deaton, 2017).    
 - 8 - 
before the last two recessions (the dashed red line), it could reflect a structural change in 
firms’ reliance on part-time labor.13  In addition, these two measures have to be weighed 
against other labor indicators that have either returned to, or are currently above, their 
pre-recession levels.  As shown in figure 7, those indicators include the quits rate (the 
short-dashed blue line), household perceptions of job availability (the short-and-long-
dashed green line), the jobs opening rate (the long-dashed red line), and the percentage of 
small firms finding it hard to fill jobs (the solid black line).   
On balance, the unemployment rate probably is correct in signaling that overall 
labor market conditions have returned to pre-crisis levels.  But that return does not 
necessarily demonstrate that the economy is now at maximum employment because, due 
to demographic and other structural changes, the unemployment rate that is sustainable 
today may be lower than the rate that was sustainable in the past.   
In that regard, some observers have pointed to the continued subdued pace of 
wage growth as evidence that the economy is not yet back to full employment.  As shown 
in figure 8, labor compensation as measured by the employment cost index (the short-
dashed red line) has been growing at more or less the same rate since 2014, and hourly 
compensation in the nonfarm business sector (the short-and-long-dashed green line)--a 
quite noisy measure, even after smoothing--is actually growing more slowly.  But growth 
in average hourly earnings (the solid blue line) and the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth 
Tracker (the long-dashed black line) have clearly picked up.14  In addition, productivity 
                                                 
13 For a discussion of how secular forces may be influencing the trend share of part-time employment, see 
Valletta and van der List (2015).   
14 In contrast to the other wage and compensation measures, the Wage Growth Tracker only measures wage 
changes for individuals who had a job in both the current month and a year ago. 
 - 9 - 
growth has been quite weak in recent years, and empirical analysis suggests that it is has 
been holding down aggregate growth in labor compensation independent of labor 
utilization in recent years.15  An analysis of the pattern of wage growth at the U.S. state 
level also suggests that subdued growth for the country as a whole probably reflects 
sluggish productivity or some other factor common to all states, because cross-state 
differences in wage growth are about what one would expect given cross-state differences 
in unemployment rates.16  Finally, I would note that the percentage of firms planning 
wage increases has moved back up to its pre-recession level, many firms report 
difficulties in finding qualified workers, and some have responded by expanding training 
programs and offering signing bonuses--possible harbingers of stronger wage gains 
to come.   
Overall, I view the data we have in hand as suggesting a generally healthy labor 
market, not one in which substantial slack remains or one that is overheated.  That said, 
the evidence does not allow for any definitive assessment, so policymakers must remain 
open minded on this question and its implications for reaching our inflation goal.  
Inflation Expectations 
Another source of uncertainty concerns inflation expectations.  In standard 
economic models, inflation expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation 
because, in deciding how much to adjust wages for individual jobs and prices of goods 
                                                 
15 For example, predictions from a simple empirical model track recent movements in the employment cost 
index reasonably well, because the model estimates that the increasing upward pressure on compensation 
growth from rising labor utilization is being offset by a declining contribution from productivity growth.  
(See the appendix for further details.)  Relatedly, research also suggests that cyclical changes in the 
composition of the workforce associated with the absorption of new workers with relatively low skills and 
experience may be currently restraining growth in both aggregate wages and productivity. See Daly and 
Hobijn (2017) and Daly, Hobijn, and Pyle (2016), who also point to the retirement of baby boomers as a 
factor holding down wage growth. 
16 See J.P. Morgan (2017) for more on this analysis.

and services at a particular time, firms take into account the rate of overall inflation they 
expect to prevail in the future.  Monetary policy presumably plays a key role in shaping 
these expectations by influencing the average rate of inflation experienced in the past 
over long periods of time, as well as by providing guidance about the FOMC’s objectives 
for inflation in the future.  Even so, economists’ understanding of exactly how and why 
inflation expectations change over time is limited.17  Moreover, we have to contend with 
the fact that we do not directly observe the inflation expectations relevant to wage and 
price setting.  Instead, we can only imperfectly infer how they might have changed based 
on survey responses and other data. 
The FOMC’s outlook depends importantly on the view that longer-run inflation 
expectations have been stable for many years at a level consistent with PCE price 
inflation that will average around 2 percent in the longer run.  Provided this stability 
continues, standard models suggest that actual inflation should stabilize at about 
2 percent over the next two or three years in an environment of roughly full employment, 
absent any future shocks.  However, there is a risk that inflation expectations may not be 
as well anchored as they appear and perhaps are not consistent with our 2 percent goal.  
To assess this risk, the FOMC considers a variety of survey measures of expected longer-
run inflation, some of which are shown in figure 9.  Long-range projections of PCE price 
inflation made by private forecasters, the solid red line, have been remarkably stable for 
many years, as have been the longer-run inflation expectations reported in surveys of 
                                                 
17 As I discussed in a speech one year ago, I view expectations formation as one of the key areas requiring 
further research by economists (see Yellen, 2016).

financial market participants (not shown).18  Households’ longer-term expectations as 
reported in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the short-dashed blue line, 
have also been fairly stable overall since the late 1990s.19  That said, results from this 
survey, as well as a survey of consumers carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, do hint that expectations may have slipped a bit over the past two or three years.  If 
so, stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent could prove to be more difficult than 
expected.20 
In theory, differences between yields on conventional Treasury securities and 
those on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are also informative about 
inflation expectations in that they measure the compensation received by investors for 
exposing themselves to future changes in consumer prices.  As indicated by the long-
dashed green line, TIPS inflation compensation for the five-year period starting five years 
from now has fallen roughly 1 percentage point over the past three years.  This decline 
                                                 
18 In the Survey of Primary Dealers conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the median of 
respondents’ longer-term projections for PCE inflation have been essentially flat at 2 percent since the 
survey began in 2011.  Similarly, in the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey, which solicits the views of a 
large number of financial firms (as well as a few other institutions) about the extended outlook every June 
and December, the median of long-run expectations for GDP price inflation has stayed close to 2.1 percent 
over the past six years.  Comparisons of results from these surveys to those reported in the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (as well as surveys of households) are somewhat complicated by differences in the 
projection period used.  For example, some surveys include the low rates of inflation expected over the next 
few years in the calculation of projected longer-run averages, while other surveys exclude them. 
19 Expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years as reported in the Michigan survey runs appreciably above 
PCE price inflation on average since the mid-1990s, perhaps because households are less informed about 
actual inflation developments than professional forecasters and financial firms.  For this reason, it may be 
best to focus on changes over time in the Michigan measure, not on the level.   
20 In addition to monitoring survey measures of expected inflation, Federal Reserve staff also use statistical 
techniques to try to directly estimate possible movements over time in the underlying long-run trend in 
inflation, using data for actual inflation and other series, including resource utilization.  Many of these 
statistical estimates suggest that the underlying trend in PCE inflation is currently somewhat below 
2 percent.  Econometrically, however, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to disentangle estimates of 
the underlying trend in PCE inflation from estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment.  To be 
consistent with the data, the higher one’s estimate of trend inflation or expected long-run inflation, the 
lower must be one’s estimate of the sustainable unemployment rate, at least over the medium run.

could be interpreted as a significant drop in market participants’ expectations for the most 
likely outcome for inflation in the longer run.  However, research suggests that the fall in 
TIPS inflation compensation instead primarily reflects a decline in inflation risk 
premiums and differences in the liquidity of nominal and indexed Treasury securities.21  
This research notwithstanding, the notable decline in inflation compensation may be a 
sign that longer-term inflation expectations have slipped recently. 
Misspecified Inflation Dynamics 
Another risk is that our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be 
misspecified in some fundamental way, perhaps because our econometric models 
overlook some factor that will restrain inflation in coming years despite solid labor 
market conditions.  One possibility in this vein is a continuation of the subdued growth in 
health-care prices that we have seen in recent years--a sector-specific factor not 
controlled for in standard models.  Because health care accounts for a large share of total 
consumer spending, this slow growth has restrained overall inflation materially and may 
continue to do so for some time.22  A similar situation occurred during the 1990s, when a 
significant shift in health insurance enrollment away from fee-for-service and toward 
HMO (that is, Health Maintenance Organization) plans reduced cost pressures and held 
                                                 
21 For example, Andreasen and Christensen (2016) show that once TIPS liquidity premiums are taken into 
account, the model-implied one-year inflation expectation becomes more stable and shows a smaller 
decline since 2013.  In addition, quotes on inflation derivatives suggest that most of the decline in inflation 
compensation over this period is associated with investor perceptions of reduced risks of above-target 
inflation outcomes rather than increased risks of below-target inflation outcomes. 
22 Personal consumption expenditures include all medical services, including those paid by Medicare and 
Medicaid; prices for the latter may be viewed as “administered” because they are essentially set by the 
government.  The formulas used to set Medicare prices were adjusted by the 2010 Affordable Care Act and 
additional legislation passed in 2015, resulting in smaller increases in prices for the same increase in costs 
than would have been the case in the prior decade.  In addition, Medicaid prices have probably been 
restrained somewhat by budget pressures on state governments.  Aside from these direct influences of 
government policy on healthcare prices, some research suggests that lower Medicare prices tend to lead to 
lower negotiated prices by private insurers as well (see Clemens, Gottlieb, and Shapiro, 2016).

down overall inflation for several years.  If these sorts of favorable supply-type shocks 
continue, achieving our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium term may require a 
more accommodative stance of monetary policy than might otherwise be appropriate.  
Some commentators have conjectured that, because of rising trade volumes and 
the integration of production chains across countries, U.S. inflation now depends on 
global resource utilization, not just on conditions here at home and those effects arising 
through movements in energy and import prices.  However, studies of this issue do not, 
on balance, provide much empirical support for this possibility.23  Moreover, foreign 
economic growth has firmed this year and the global economy appears to have largely 
recovered, so any influence that global resource utilization might have on U.S. inflation 
would presumably be small.  Nevertheless, increased competition from the integration of 
China and other emerging market countries into the world economy may have materially 
restrained price margins and labor compensation in the United States and other advanced 
economies.  In fact, one study concludes that most of the decline in the labor share of 
national income in the United States since the late 1980s can be attributed to offshoring 
of labor-intensive production.24  If this restraint on the labor share continues to build over 
                                                 
23 In an early study, Borio and Filardo (2007) reported results suggesting that global economic slack adds 
considerable explanatory power to reduced-form inflation equations (such as the one discussed in the 
appendix), and that its role has been growing over time.  However, Ihrig, Kamin, Lindner, and Marquez 
(2010) subsequently argued that the estimated link was not robust to alternative measures of global 
resource utilization.  Federal Reserve Board staff have updated this analysis using data through early 2017 
and confirmed that global slack does not appear to exert an appreciable direct effect on domestic inflation 
in the United States and most other advanced economies. 
24 Using sector-level data, Elsby, Hobijn, and Sahin (2013) estimate the contributions of offshoring, the 
substitution of capital for low-skilled labor, and several other factors on the aggregate U.S. labor share of 
income, and find that only offshoring has been important.  They also conclude that the decline in the labor 
share since the late 1980s has been overstated as a result of statistical measurement problems.  In contrast 
to the influence of globalization on the U.S. labor share, Feenstra and Weinstein (2017) find that the 
influence of increased globalization on price markups in the United States has been modest.

the next few years (and not merely holds steady), then it could indirectly hold down the 
growth of domestic wages and prices in ways not captured by conventional models.   
More speculatively, changes in the structure of the domestic economy may also 
be altering inflation dynamics in ways not captured by conventional models.  The 
growing importance of online shopping, by increasing the competitiveness of the U.S. 
retail sector, may have reduced price margins and restrained the ability of firms to raise 
prices in response to rising demand.25  That said, the economy overall appears to have 
become more concentrated and less dynamic in recent years, which may tend to increase 
firms’ pricing power.26  Because these changes occur slowly, determining their complex 
effects on the economy will, as a practical matter, require studying data over a 
considerable time.   
Finally, I would note the possibility that inflation may rise more sharply in 
response to robust labor market conditions than anticipated.  The influence of labor 
utilization on inflation has become quite modest over the past 20 years, implying that the 
inflationary consequences of misjudging the sustainable rate of unemployment are low.  
But we cannot be sure that this modest sensitivity will persist in the face of strong labor 
market conditions, given that we do not fully understand how it came to be so modest in 
the first place.  Although the evidence is weak that inflation responds in a nonlinear 
manner to resource utilization, this risk is one that we cannot entirely dismiss.

Policy Implications 
What are the policy implications of these uncertainties?  For one, my colleagues 
and I must be ready to adjust our assessments of economic conditions and the outlook 
when new data warrant it.  In this spirit, FOMC participants--like private forecasters--
have reduced their estimates of the sustainable unemployment rate appreciably over the 
past few years in response to the continual flow of information about the always changing 
economy.27  To the extent these assessments change over time, so too will the outlook 
and judgments about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Importantly, even if 
resource utilization is currently lower than we estimate or if longer-run inflation 
expectations are running at levels consistent with longer-run PCE price inflation 
somewhat below 2 percent, the FOMC can still achieve its inflation goal.  Under those 
conditions, continuing to revise our assessments in response to incoming data would 
naturally result in a policy path that is somewhat easier than that now anticipated--an 
appropriate course correction that would reflect our commitment to maximum 
employment and price stability. 
Similar considerations apply to other important sources of uncertainty, such as the 
value of the neutral real interest rate--that is, the inflation-adjusted level of the federal 
funds rate consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.  Estimates of 
this rate have declined considerably in recent years, and, by some estimates, the real 
neutral rate is currently close to zero.  But the neutral rate changes over time as a result of 
the interaction of many forces, including demographics, productivity growth, fiscal 
                                                 
27 The median of FOMC participants’ projections of the longer-run unemployment rate has declined almost 
a full percentage point over the past five years; the revision in the long-run consensus forecast reported in 
the Blue Chip Survey between October 2012 and March 2017 was slightly larger.  
 - 16 - 
policy, and the strength of global demand, so its value at any point in time cannot be 
estimated or projected with much precision.  My FOMC colleagues and I will therefore 
need to continue to reassess and revise our assessments of the neutral rate in response to 
incoming data and adjust monetary policy accordingly.  
How should policy be formulated in the face of such significant uncertainties?  In 
my view, it strengthens the case for a gradual pace of adjustments.  Moving too quickly 
risks overadjusting policy to head off projected developments that may not come to pass.  
A gradual approach is particularly appropriate in light of subdued inflation and a low 
neutral real interest rate, which imply that the FOMC will have only limited scope to cut 
the federal funds rate should the economy be hit with an adverse shock.28  But we should 
also be wary of moving too gradually.  Job gains continue to run well ahead of the 
longer-run pace we estimate would be sufficient, on average, to provide jobs for new 
entrants to the labor force.  Thus, without further modest increases in the federal funds 
rate over time, there is a risk that the labor market could eventually become overheated, 
potentially creating an inflationary problem down the road that might be difficult to 
overcome without triggering a recession.  Persistently easy monetary policy might also 
eventually lead to increased leverage and other developments, with adverse implications 
for financial stability.  For these reasons, and given that monetary policy affects 
economic activity and inflation with a substantial lag, it would be imprudent to keep 
monetary policy on hold until inflation is back to 2 percent.   
                                                 
28 It might be thought that the FOMC could mitigate this problem by raising the federal funds rate higher 
than might otherwise be called for while the economy continues to expand in order to increase the extent to 
which interest rates could be cut later should a recession occur.  But this strategy would be 
counterproductive, because it would only serve to weaken economic activity and push down inflation 
before the recession. 
 Conclusion 
- 17 - 
To conclude, standard empirical analyses support the FOMC’s outlook that, with 
gradual adjustments in monetary policy, inflation will stabilize at around the FOMC’s 
2 percent objective over the next few years, accompanied by some further strengthening 
in labor market conditions.  But the outlook is uncertain, reflecting, among other things, 
the inherent imprecision in our estimates of labor utilization, inflation expectations, and 
other factors.  As a result, we will need to carefully monitor the incoming data and, as 
warranted, adjust our assessments of the outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy.  But in making these adjustments, our longer-run objectives will remain 
unchanged--to promote maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

Appendix:  PCE Inflation Model, Inflation Decomposition Procedure, and the ECI 
Growth Equation 
PCE Inflation Model 
The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations:  
an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE price inflation.  The 
identity is  
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡=𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐+𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑓𝑓𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡, 
in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is 
prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐=.41𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒+.36𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑐𝑐 +.23𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑐𝑐 −.08𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡+.56𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑐𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 
and core PCE prices, respectively.  𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 and 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 
expressed relative to core PCE prices, and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝜔𝜔𝑡𝑡𝑓𝑓are the weights of energy and food 
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization, 
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods, 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 
For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate 
rate.  From 2007 to the present, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 is approximated using the median forecasts of long-
less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural 
is a white-noise error term, and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 
obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4.29 
                                                 
29 Although the data used in the decomposition analysis have been revised and extended, the specification 
of the model and the estimation period are the same as that discussed in a speech I gave two years ago 
(Yellen, 2015).  As a result, the estimated coefficients of the model are essentially unchanged.  Extending 
the estimation period through 2017:Q2 has little effect on the estimated coefficients and the decomposition 
estimates.

run PCE price inflation reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters; from 1991:Q4 
to 2006:Q4, the series is based on the median long-run forecasts of inflation as measured 
by the consumer price index (CPI), less a constant adjustment of 40 basis points to put 
the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis; before 1991:Q4, (cid:2024)(cid:3047)(cid:3032) is approximated by the long-run 
(cid:1844)(cid:1842)(cid:1835)(cid:1839)(cid:3047), is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price index for core imported 
inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.  The relative import price term, 
goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and semiconductors) less 
the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied by the share of 
nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.30 
Inflation Decomposition Procedure 
To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the 
series used in the inflation model--for which complete quarterly data are available only 
through 2017:Q2 in most cases--are first extended through the end of 2017.  In the case 
of inflation, the extensions are consistent with the medians of Federal Open Market 
Committee (FOMC) participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation in 2017 that 
were reported at the press conference following the September 2017 FOMC meeting.31  
Similarly, (cid:1845)(cid:1838)(cid:1827)(cid:1829)(cid:1837)(cid:3047) over the second half of 2017 is defined to be consistent with the 
median of FOMC projections for the 2017:Q4 unemployment rate less the CBO’s 
estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate.  The CBO’s 2017 estimate is 
slightly higher than the median of FOMC participants’ most recent projections of the 
                                                 
30 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data 
provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
31 The information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 20, 2017, press conference is 
available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20170920.pdf.

normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  For changes in the price of core 
imports, the 2017:H2 extrapolations are based on a regression of this series on current 
and lagged changes in exchange rates.  This approach predicts that core import prices 
should rise about 4-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.32  Energy 
and food prices over the second half of 2017 are assumed to rise at annual rates of 
10 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively; these assumptions (which take into account 
published monthly PCE data through July and published CPI data through August, as 
well as recent movements in gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma) 
ensure that the combined contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2017 is 
consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total 
and core inflation.  Finally, nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports 
are assumed to remain unchanged at their 2017:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation 
expectations are assumed to remain constant at 2 percent. 
After computing historical 𝜖𝜖𝑡𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 
the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counterfactual 
simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2017:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 
variable of the model is set to zero, and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 
between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 
                                                 
32 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 
downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 
one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post-2001 pattern persists 
in coming years, then 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains 
near 4-1/2 percent (the median of the longer-run projections provided by FOMC participants) and there are 
no further shocks to the exchange rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to 
resume trending down relative to consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the 
unemployment rate consistent with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat 
lower than 4-1/2 percent.

particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 
term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 
period rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the effects 
of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 
explanatory variables. 
ECI Growth Equation 
The estimated equation for the employment cost index (ECI) is: 
.57∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡+.58𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡+𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡, 
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤=−0.72+.58𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒 +.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑤𝑤 +.12𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2𝑤𝑤 +.10𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−3𝑤𝑤 +.11𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−4𝑤𝑤 −.19𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡−
where 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑤𝑤 is the annualized log difference of the ECI for hourly compensation of private 
industry workers, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 have the same definition as the corresponding variables 
from the PCE price inflation model, ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 denotes the first difference of 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡, 
𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 is a moving average of an estimate of trend productivity growth for the 
business sector, and 𝜀𝜀𝑡𝑡 is an error term.33  The coefficients are obtained from a restricted 
least squares regression using quarterly data from 1988:Q1 to 2017:Q2.34  Trend 
productivity growth is estimated as the low-frequency component of the annualized log 
difference of business-sector output per hour from the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
Productivity and Costs report.35  The moving average of trend productivity growth 
                                                 
33 The ECI series used here is obtained from a ratio splice of the SIC- and NAICS-based indexes; the SIC-
based index is used before 2001 and the NAICS-based index used thereafter.  (All data used in the model 
were current as of September 1, 2017.)   
34 The estimation procedure imposes the joint restriction that the sum of the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒
lagged ECI growth terms are equal to 1, and that the coefficients on 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1𝑒𝑒
joint restriction receives a p value of 0.57.  
35 The low-pass component is obtained from a band-pass filter.  The filter width and cutoffs are set equal to 
the values used in Douglas Staiger, James Stock, and Mark Watson (2001), “Prices, Wages, and the U.S. 
NAIRU in the 1990s,” in Alan Krueger and Robert Solow, eds., The Roaring Nineties:  Can Full 
Employment Be Sustained? (New York:  Russell Sage Foundation and Century Foundation Press), pp. 3-60.  
 and 𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 are equal.  This

(which is used in the estimation) is computed as a geometrically declining weighted 
average, 
𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡=0.95𝑅𝑅𝑆𝑆_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡−1+0.05𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡, 
where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡 denotes trend productivity growth and where the moving average is 
initialized in 1955:Q1 with that quarter’s estimate of the trend growth rate. 
The model is used to compute a decomposition of ECI growth following a 
procedure similar to that used to construct the decomposition for core PCE price 
inflation.  The table summarizes the results of this decomposition over various periods; 
note that the column labeled “Slack” combines the effects of ∆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡 and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡, the 
effect of the model’s constant term is included in the column labeled “Trend 
productivity,” and the column labeled “Other” gives the contributions of the model’s 
tracking errors.

model; after its 2017:Q2 endpoint, the series is padded with the CBO’s January 2017 forecast of average 
nonfarm business trend productivity growth from 2017 to 2027 (which is 1.67 percent in log differences) 
and with the 2027 value of the CBO forecast (1.77 percent) thereafter.
