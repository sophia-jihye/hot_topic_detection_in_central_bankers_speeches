Alan Greenspan: The September 11 tragedy and the response of the financial industry Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the American Bankers Associationâ€™s Virtual Annual Convention (taped statement)  23 October 2001. I am pleased to speak once again to an American Bankers Association convention. This conference was rescheduled in respect for the loss of our colleagues and fellow citizens in the tragedy of September 11. But the fact that the conference is going forward in cyberspace is a testimony to American perseverance  to our technology  and to our flexibility. It is a metaphor for the ability of our economy to circumvent difficulties and innovate around obstacles and--most of all--for our decentralized and diversified economic structure. Our financial system has exactly such a structure. It still has thousands of banks  with hundreds of foreign competitors  including some of the largest banks in the world. In addition  market developments  regulatory relief  and  most recently  legislative reform have ensured that the banks  the insurance companies  the securities firms  the finance companies  and the host of other participants  from pension funds to hedge funds and from trusts to mutual funds  are all  in effect  in each other's business. And this listing does not even take into account a capital market where lenders and borrowers deal directly and where increasingly the instruments and risks originated by financial intermediaries come to rest. These activities could be done much more efficiently in a technology sense by far fewer entities  but our seemingly crazy quilt structure creates a different kind of efficiency--one that emphasizes constant cost minimization  innovation  and flexibility. And that is exactly what we saw a couple of weeks ago  when literally within hours of the attack on the World Trade Center--with many of the participants still grieving and with the loss of extraordinary personnel and resources--our financial system was finding ways to return to operation. Some examples will clarify this creativity of our system. With borrowers and lenders uncertain whether the financial markets were open and with communications among issuers  their banks  and the settlement system impaired  there were difficulties in rolling over maturing commercial paper. The resulting shortfalls in the coverage of billions of dollars of maturing paper were managed by rolling fails into the next day's settlement or by drawing on bank lines  causing bank assets to balloon for a few days. Similarly  disruptions in the connectivity of communication lines and the shift to backup sites caused delays in payments and settlements  with billions in funds building up at a small number of participants unable to send out funds covered by similar amounts of Federal Reserve open market operations  overdrafts  and loans to those who could not receive. To facilitate the channeling of dollar liquidity to foreign financial institutions operating in the United States and to meet all appropriate demands for dollar liquidity  thirty-day currency swap lines were arranged with major central banks  again in record volume. Fed and bank balance sheets ballooned with the maldistribution of reserves  and domestic and foreign operations  but there was no fear of either credit or liquidity risk. Fed funds borrowers and lenders  forced to deal directly because brokers were temporarily unavailable  quickly reached agreements to trade at the targeted federal funds rate. Similarly  in response to losses of personnel and equipment at some participants  dealers agreed voluntarily to extend settlement in the Treasury market their commitments  real and implied  to avoid the disruptions that were a large part of the terrorists' objective. The list of adjustments and innovations goes on and on. But the point is clear that we are blessed with a financial system that is creative  that is flexible  that is innovative. Banks--including the central bank-- were there when they were needed and did what was required with dispatch. We should be proud of the banking system's role in minimizing the economic fallout of that tragic day. in particular--stepped up to T+5. Crucially  lenders--banks to meet BIS Review 88/2001 1
