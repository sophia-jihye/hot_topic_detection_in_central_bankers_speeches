Ben S Bernanke: Federal Reserve programs to strengthen credit markets and the economy Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Financial Services  US House of Representatives  Washington  DC  10 February 2009. The original speech  which contains various links to the documents mentioned  can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. Chairman Frank  Ranking Member Bachus  and other members of the Committee  I appreciate this opportunity to provide a brief review of the Federal Reserve's various credit programs  including those relying on our emergency authorities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. I will also discuss the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to inform the Congress and the public about these activities. Federal Reserve programs to strengthen credit markets and the economy As you know  the past 18 months or so have been extraordinarily challenging for policymakers around the globe  not least for central banks. The Federal Reserve has responded forcefully to the financial and economic crisis since its emergence in the summer of 2007. Monetary policy has been especially proactive. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began to ease monetary policy in September 2007 and continued to ease in response to a weakening economic outlook. In December 2008  the Committee set a range of 0 to 25 basis points for the target federal funds rate. Although the target for the federal funds rate is at its effective floor  the Federal Reserve has employed at least three types of additional tools to improve the functioning of credit markets  ease financial conditions  and support economic activity. The first set of tools is closely tied to the central bank's traditional role of providing short-term liquidity to sound financial institutions. Over the course of the crisis  the Fed has taken a number of extraordinary actions  including the creation of a number of new facilities for auctioning short-term credit  to ensure that financial institutions have adequate access to liquidity. In fulfilling its traditional lending function  the Federal Reserve enhances the stability of our financial system  increases the willingness of financial institutions to extend credit  and helps to ease conditions in interbank lending markets  reducing the overall cost of capital to banks. In addition  some interest rates  including the rates on some adjustable-rate mortgages  are tied contractually to key interbank rates  such as the London interbank offered rate (Libor). To the extent that the provision of ample liquidity to banks reduces Libor  other borrowers will also see their payments decline. Because interbank markets are global in scope  the Federal Reserve has also approved bilateral currency liquidity agreements with 14 foreign central banks. These so-called swap facilities have allowed these central banks to acquire dollars from the Federal Reserve that the foreign central banks may lend to financial institutions in their jurisdictions. The purpose of these liquidity swaps is to ease conditions in dollar funding markets globally. Improvements in global interbank markets  in turn  promote greater stability in other markets at home and abroad  such as money markets and foreign exchange markets. The provision of short-term credit to financial institutions exposes the Federal Reserve to minimal credit risk  as the loans we make to financial institutions are generally short-term  overcollateralized  and made with recourse to the borrowing firm. In the case of the currency swaps  the foreign central banks are responsible for repaying the Federal Reserve  not the BIS Review 15/2009 1 financial institutions that ultimately receive the funds  and the Fed receives an equivalent amount of foreign currency in exchange for the dollars it provides foreign central banks. Although the provision of ample liquidity by the central bank to financial institutions is a time- tested approach to reducing financial strains  it is no panacea. Today  concerns about capital  asset quality  and credit risk continue to limit the willingness of many intermediaries to extend credit  notwithstanding the access of these firms to central bank liquidity. Moreover  providing liquidity to financial institutions does not directly address instability or declining credit availability in critical nonbank markets  such as the commercial paper market or the market for asset-backed securities. To address these issues  the Federal Reserve has developed a second set of policy tools which involve the provision of liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in key credit markets. For example  we have introduced facilities to purchase highly rated commercial paper at a term of three months and to provide backup liquidity for money market mutual funds. In addition  the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have jointly announced a facility – expected to be operational shortly – that will lend against AAA-rated asset-backed securities collateralized by recently originated student loans  auto loans  credit card loans  and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. Unlike our other lending programs  this facility combines Federal Reserve liquidity with capital provided by the Treasury. If the program works as planned  it should help to restart activity in these key securitization markets and lead to lower borrowing rates and improved access in the markets for consumer and small business credit. This basic framework could also be expanded to accommodate higher volumes as well as additional classes of securities  as circumstances warrant. These special lending programs have been set up to minimize credit risk to the Federal Reserve. The largest program  the commercial paper funding facility  accepts only the most highly rated paper. It also charges borrowers a premium  which is set aside against possible losses. As just noted  the facility that will lend against securities backed by consumer and small-business loans is a joint Federal Reserve-Treasury program; capital provided by the Treasury from the Troubled Asset Relief Program will help insulate the Federal Reserve from credit losses (and the Treasury will receive most of the upside from these loans). The Federal Reserve's third set of policy tools for supporting the functioning of credit markets involves the purchase of longer-term securities for the Fed's portfolio. For example  we recently announced plans to purchase up to $100 billion of the debt of government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs)  including Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac  and the Federal Home Loan Banks  and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by midyear. The objective of these purchases is to lower mortgage rates  thereby supporting housing activity and the broader economy. The Federal Reserve is engaged in an ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of its credit- related tools. Measuring the impact of our programs is complicated by the fact that multiple factors affect market conditions. Nevertheless  we have been encouraged by the responses to these programs  including the reports and evaluations offered by market participants and analysts. Notably  our lending to financial institutions  together with actions taken by other agencies  has helped to relax the severe liquidity strains experienced by many firms and has been associated with considerable improvements in interbank lending markets. For example  we believe that the aggressive liquidity provision by the Fed and other central banks has contributed to the recent declines in Libor and is a principal reason that liquidity pressures around the end of the year--often a period of heightened liquidity strains--were relatively modest. There is widespread agreement that our commercial paper funding facility has helped to stabilize the commercial paper market  lowering rates significantly and allowing firms access to financing at terms longer than a few days. Together with other government programs  our actions to stabilize the money market mutual fund industry have also shown some measure of success  as the sharp withdrawals from funds seen in September have given way to modest inflows. And our purchases of agency debt and MBS seem to have had 2 BIS Review 15/2009 a significant effect on conforming mortgage rates  with rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages falling close to a percentage point since the announcement of the program. All of these improvements have occurred over a period in which the economic news has generally been worse than expected and conditions in many financial markets  including the equity markets  have worsened. We evaluate existing and prospective programs based on the answers to three questions: First  has normal functioning in the credit market in question been severely disrupted by the crisis? Second  does the Federal Reserve have tools that are likely to lead to significant improvement in function and credit availability in that market  and are the Federal Reserve's tools the most effective methods  either alone or in combination with those of other agencies  to address the disruption? And third  do improved conditions in the particular market have the potential to make a significant difference for the overall economy? To illustrate  our purchases of agency debt and MBS meet all three criteria: The mortgage market is significantly impaired  the Fed's authority to purchase agency securities gives us a straightforward tool to try to reduce the extent of that impairment  and the health of the housing market bears directly and importantly on the performance of the broader economy. is "unable the borrower The use of authorities under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to make secured loans to individuals  partnerships  or corporations in "unusual and exigent circumstances" and when to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions." This authority  added to the Federal Reserve Act in 1932  was intended to give the Federal Reserve the flexibility to respond to emergency conditions. Prior to 2008  credit had not been extended under this authority since the 1930s.1 However  responding to the extraordinarily stressed conditions in financial markets  the Board has used this authority on a number of occasions over the past year. Following the Bear Stearns episode in March 2008  the Federal Reserve Board invoked Section 13(3) to make primary securities dealers  as well as banks  eligible to borrow on a short-term basis from the Fed.2 This decision was taken in support of financial stability  during a period in which the investment banks and other dealers faced intense liquidity pressures.3 The Fed has also made use of the Section 13(3) authority in its programs to support the functioning of key credit markets  including the commercial paper market and the market for asset-backed securities. In my view  the use of Section 13(3) in these contexts is well justified in light of the breakdowns of these critical markets and the serious implications of those breakdowns for the health of the broader economy. As financial conditions improve and circumstances are no longer "unusual and exigent " the programs authorized under Section 13(3) will be wound down  as required by law. Other components of the Federal Reserve's credit programs  including our lending to depository institutions  liquidity swaps with other central banks  and purchases of agency securities  make no use of the powers conferred by Section 13(3). In a distinct set of activities  the Federal Reserve has also used its Section 13(3) authority to support government efforts to stabilize systemically critical financial institutions. The Federal 1 The Federal Reserve invoked this provision twice in the 1960s to authorize lending but no credit was drawn. 2 Primary dealers are broker-dealers that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The New York Fed's Open Market Desk engages in trades on behalf of the Federal Reserve System to implement monetary policy. 3 Most other major central banks already provide short-term credit to a broader range of financial institutions  so in making this change  the Fed was conforming to international practice for the period of the financial emergency. BIS Review 15/2009 3 Reserve collaborated with the Treasury to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and to prevent the failure of the American International Group (AIG)  and we worked closely with the Treasury and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to help to stabilize Citigroup and the Bank of America. In the cases of Bear Stearns and AIG  as part of a strategy to avoid impending defaults by the companies  the Federal Reserve made loans against pools of collateral. Activities to stabilize systemically important institutions seem to me to be quite different in character from the use of Section 13(3) authority to support the repair of credit markets. The actions that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have taken to stabilize systemically critical firms were essential to protect the financial system as a whole  and  in particular  the financial risks inherent in the credits extended by the Federal Reserve were  in my view  greatly outweighed by the risks that would have been faced by the financial system and the economy had we not stepped in. However  many of these actions might not have been necessary in the first place had there been in place a comprehensive resolution regime aimed at avoiding the disorderly failure of systemically critical financial institutions. The Federal Reserve believes that the development of a robust resolution regime should be a top legislative priority. If the specification of this regime were to include clear expectations of the Federal Reserve's role in stabilizing or resolving systemically important firms--a step we very much support--then the contingencies in which the Fed might need to invoke emergency authorities could be tightly circumscribed. Transparency and disclosure I would like to conclude by discussing the Federal Reserve's ongoing efforts to inform the Congress and the public about its various lending programs. I firmly believe that central banks should be as transparent as possible  both for reasons of democratic accountability and because many of our policies are likely to be more effective if they are well understood by the markets and the public. During my time at the Federal Reserve  the FOMC has taken important steps to increase the transparency of monetary policy  such as moving up the publication of the minutes of policy meetings and adopting the practice of providing longer-term projections of the evolution of the economy on a quarterly basis. Likewise  the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping the Congress and the public informed about its lending programs and balance sheet. For example  we continue to add to the information shown in the Fed's H.4.1 release  which provides weekly detail on the balance sheet and the amounts outstanding for each of the Federal Reserve's lending facilities. Extensive additional information about each of the Federal Reserve's lending programs is available online  as shown in the appendix to this testimony. Pursuant to a requirement included in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act passed in October  the Fed also provides monthly reports to the Congress on each of its programs that rely on the Section 13(3) authorities. Generally  the Fed's disclosure policies are consistent with the current best practices of major central banks around the world. That said  recent developments have understandably led to a substantial increase in the public's interest in the Fed's balance sheet and programs. For this reason  we at the Fed have begun a thorough review of our disclosure policies and the effectiveness of our communication. Today I would like to mention two initiatives. First  to improve public access to information concerning Fed policies and programs  Federal Reserve staff are developing a new website that will bring together in a systematic and comprehensive way the full range of information that the Federal Reserve already makes available  supplemented by new explanations  discussions  and analyses. Our goal is to have this website operational within a few weeks. Second  at my request  Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn has agreed to lead a committee that will review our current publications and disclosure policies relating to the Fed's balance 4 BIS Review 15/2009 sheet and lending policies. The presumption of the committee will be that the public has a right to know  and that the nondisclosure of information must be affirmatively justified by clearly articulated criteria for confidentiality  based on factors such as reasonable claims to privacy  the confidentiality of supervisory information  and the effectiveness of policy. Thank you. I will be pleased to respond to your questions.
