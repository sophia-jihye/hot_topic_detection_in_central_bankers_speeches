Ben S Bernanke: Developments in the financial markets Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs  US Senate  Washington DC  3 April 2008. Chairman Dodd  Senator Shelby  and other members of the Committee  I appreciate this opportunity to discuss current economic and financial conditions and the actions the Federal Reserve has taken to stabilize financial markets and the economy. Although the situation has recently improved somewhat  financial markets remain under considerable stress. Pressures in short-term bank funding markets  which had abated somewhat beginning late last year  have increased once again. Many lenders have been reluctant to provide credit to counterparties  especially leveraged investors  and increased the amount of collateral they required to back short-term security financing agreements. To meet those demands  investors have reduced their leverage and liquidated holdings of securities  putting further downward pressure on security prices. Credit availability has also been restricted because some large financial institutions  including some commercial and investment banks and the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)  have reported substantial losses and writedowns  reducing their capital available to support increased lending. Some key securitization markets  including those for nonconforming mortgages  continue to function poorly if at all. These developments in financial markets – which themselves reflect  in part  greater concerns about housing and the economic outlook more generally – have weighed on real economic activity. Notably  in the housing market  sales of both new and existing homes have generally continued weak  partly as a result of the reduced availability of mortgage credit  and home prices have continued to fall. Private payroll employment fell substantially in February  after two months of smaller job losses  with job cuts in construction and closely related industries accounting for a significant share of the decline. But the demand for labor has also moderated recently in other industries. Overall  the near-term economic outlook has weakened relative to the projections released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at the end of January. Inflation has also been a source of concern. We expect inflation to moderate in coming quarters  but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Well-functioning financial markets are essential for the efficacy of monetary policy and  indeed  for economic growth and stability. Consistent with its role as the nation's central bank  the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps in recent weeks to improve market liquidity and market functioning. These actions include reducing the cost and increasing the allowable term of discount window credit to commercial banks; increasing the size of our Term Auction Facility  through which credit is auctioned to depository institutions; initiating a Term Securities Lending Facility  which allows primary dealers to swap less-liquid mortgage backed securities for more-liquid Treasury securities; and creating the Primary Dealer Credit Facility  which is similar to the discount window but accessible to primary dealers. Although these facilities operate through depository institutions and primary dealers  they are designed to support the broader financial markets and the economy by facilitating the provision of liquidity by those institutions to their customers and counterparties. With respect to monetary policy  at its March meeting the FOMC reduced its target for the federal funds rate by 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. It was in this context of intensifying financial strains that  on March 13  Bear Stearns advised the Federal Reserve and other government agencies that its liquidity position had BIS Review 39/2008 1 significantly deteriorated and that it would have to file for bankruptcy the next day unless alternative sources of funds became available. This news raised difficult questions of public policy. Normally  the market sorts out which companies survive and which fail  and that is as it should be. However  the issues raised here extended well beyond the fate of one company. Our financial system is extremely complex and interconnected  and Bear Stearns participated extensively in a range of critical markets. The sudden failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence. The company's failure could also have cast doubt on the financial positions of some of Bear Stearns' thousands of counterparties and perhaps of companies with similar businesses. Given the exceptional pressures on the global economy and financial system  the damage caused by a default by Bear Stearns could have been severe and extremely difficult to contain. Moreover  the adverse impact of a default would not have been confined to the financial system but would have been felt broadly in the real economy through its effects on asset values and credit availability. To prevent a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns and the unpredictable but likely severe consequences for market functioning and the broader economy  the Federal Reserve  in close consultation with the Treasury Department  agreed to provide funding to Bear Stearns through JPMorgan Chase. Over the following weekend  JPMorgan Chase agreed to purchase Bear Stearns and assumed Bear's financial obligations. The purpose of our action  as with our other recent actions – including our provision of liquidity to financial firms and our reductions in the federal funds rate target – was  as best as possible  to improve the functioning of financial markets and to limit any adverse effects of financial turmoil on the broader economy. We will remain focused on those objectives. Clearly  the U.S. economy is going through a very difficult period. But among the great strengths of our economy is its ability to adapt and to respond to diverse challenges. Much necessary economic and financial adjustment has already taken place  and monetary and fiscal policies are in train that should support a return to growth in the second half of this year and next year. I remain confident in our economy's long-term prospects. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions. 2 BIS Review 39/20086
