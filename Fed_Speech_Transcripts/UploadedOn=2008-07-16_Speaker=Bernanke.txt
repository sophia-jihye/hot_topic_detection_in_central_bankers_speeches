Ben S Bernanke: Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress Testimony of Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  before the Committee on Banking  Housing  and Urban Affairs  US Senate  Washington DC  15 July 2008. Chairman Dodd  Senator Shelby  and members of the Committee  I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. The U.S. economy and financial system have confronted some significant challenges thus far in 2008. The contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions. The effects of the housing contraction and of the financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities  which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation. Against this backdrop  economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year  while inflation has remained elevated. Following a significant reduction in its policy rate over the second half of 2007  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy considerably further through the spring to counter actual and expected weakness in economic growth and to mitigate downside risks to economic activity. In addition  the Federal Reserve expanded some of the special liquidity programs that were established last year and implemented additional facilities to support the functioning of financial markets and foster financial stability. Although these policy actions have had positive effects  the economy continues to face numerous difficulties  including ongoing strains in financial markets  declining house prices  a softening labor market  and rising prices of oil  food  and some other commodities. Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of some of these key issues. Developments in financial markets and their implications for the macroeconomic outlook have been a focus of monetary policy makers over the past year. In the second half of 2007  the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the United States triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type. In the first quarter of 2008  reports of further losses and write-downs at financial institutions intensified investor concerns and resulted in further sharp reductions in market liquidity. By March  many dealers and other institutions  even those that had relied heavily on short-term secured financing  were facing much more stringent borrowing conditions. In mid-March  a major investment bank  The Bear Stearns Companies  Inc.  was pushed to the brink of failure after suddenly losing access to short-term financing markets. The Federal Reserve judged that a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns would pose a serious threat to overall financial stability and would most likely have significant adverse implications for the U.S. economy. After discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in consultation with the Treasury  we invoked emergency authorities to provide special financing to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. In addition  the Federal Reserve used emergency authorities to establish two new facilities to provide backstop liquidity to primary dealers  with the goals of stabilizing financial conditions and increasing the availability of credit to the broader economy.1 We have also taken additional 1 Primary dealers are financial institutions that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On behalf of the Federal Reserve System  the New York Fed's Open Market Desk engages in the trades to implement monetary policy. BIS Review 90/2008 1 steps to address liquidity pressures in the banking system  including a further easing of the terms for bank borrowing at the discount window and increases in the amount of credit made available to banks through the Term Auction Facility. The FOMC also authorized expansions of its currency swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to facilitate increased dollar lending by those institutions to banks in their jurisdictions. These steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains. During the second quarter  credit spreads generally narrowed  liquidity pressures ebbed  and a number of financial institutions raised new capital. However  as events in recent weeks have demonstrated  many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress  in part because the outlook for the economy  and thus for credit quality  remains uncertain. In recent days  investors became particularly concerned about the financial condition of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In view of this development  and given the importance of these firms to the mortgage market  the Treasury announced a legislative proposal to bolster their capital  access to liquidity  and regulatory oversight. As a supplement to the Treasury's existing authority to lend to the GSEs and as a bridge to the time when the Congress decides how to proceed on these matters  the Board of Governors authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  should that become necessary. Any lending would be collateralized by U.S. government and federal agency securities. In general  healthy economic growth depends on well-functioning financial markets. Consequently  helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the Federal Reserve. I turn now to current economic developments and prospects. The economy has continued to expand  but at a subdued pace. In the labor market  private payroll employment has declined this year  falling at an average pace of 94 000 jobs per month through June. Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors has been particularly hard hit  although employment declines in a number of other sectors are evident as well. The unemployment rate has risen and now stands at 5-1/2 percent. In the housing sector  activity continues to weaken. Although sales of existing homes have been about unchanged this year  sales of new homes have continued to fall  and inventories of unsold new homes remain high. In response  homebuilders continue to scale back the pace of housing starts. Home prices are falling  particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade. The declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures; by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale  these foreclosures have  in turn  intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas. Personal consumption expenditures have advanced at a modest pace so far this year  generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes. In particular  with the labor market softening and consumer price inflation elevated  real earnings have been stagnant so far this year; declining values of equities and houses have taken their toll on household balance sheets; credit conditions have tightened; and indicators of consumer sentiment have fallen sharply. More positively  the fiscal stimulus package is providing some timely support to household incomes. Overall  consumption spending seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters. In the business sector  real outlays for equipment and software were about flat in the first quarter of the year  and construction of nonresidential structures slowed appreciably. In the second quarter  the available data suggest that business fixed investment appears to have expanded moderately. Nevertheless  surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment  including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit  and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year. However  strong export growth continues to be a significant boon to many U.S. companies. 2 BIS Review 90/2008 In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting  Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2008 through 2010. On balance  most FOMC participants expected that  over the remainder of this year  output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate  primarily because of continued weakness in housing markets  elevated energy prices  and tight credit conditions. Growth is projected to pick up gradually over the next two years as residential construction bottoms out and begins a slow recovery and as credit conditions gradually improve. However  FOMC participants indicated that considerable uncertainty surrounded their outlook for economic growth and viewed the risks to their forecasts as skewed to the downside. Inflation has remained high  running at nearly a 3-1/2 percent annual rate over the first five months of this year as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures. And  with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks  inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term. The elevated level of overall consumer inflation largely reflects a continued sharp run-up in the prices of many commodities  especially oil but also certain crops and metals.2 The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil soared about 60 percent in 2007 and  thus far this year  has climbed an additional 50 percent or so. The price of oil currently stands at about five times its level toward the beginning of this decade. Our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets. Over the past several years  the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades  leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil. Moreover  growth has been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies  where energy consumption has been further stimulated by rapid industrialization and by government subsidies that hold down the price of energy faced by ultimate users. On the supply side  despite sharp increases in prices  the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years. Much of the subdued supply response reflects inadequate investment and production shortfalls in politically volatile regions where large portions of the world's oil reserves are located. Additionally  many governments have been tightening their control over oil resources  impeding foreign investment and hindering efforts to boost capacity and production. Finally  sustainable rates of production in some of the more secure and accessible oil fields  such as those in the North Sea  have been declining. In view of these factors  estimates of long-term oil supplies have been marked down in recent months. Long-dated oil futures prices have risen along with spot prices  suggesting that market participants also see oil supply conditions remaining tight for years to come. The decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat to the increase in oil prices. The precise size of this effect is difficult to ascertain  as the causal relationships between oil prices and the dollar are complex and run in both directions. However  the price of oil has risen significantly in terms of all major currencies  suggesting that factors other than the dollar  notably shifts in the underlying global demand for and supply of oil  have been the principal drivers of the increase in prices. Another concern that has been raised is that financial speculation has added markedly to upward pressures on oil prices. Certainly  investor interest in oil and other commodities has increased substantially of late. However  if financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand  we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But in fact  available data on oil inventories show notable declines over the past year. This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of 2 The dominant role of commodity prices in driving the recent increase in inflation can be seen by contrasting the overall inflation rate with the so-called core measure of inflation  which excludes food and energy prices. Core inflation has been fairly steady this year at an annual rate of about 2 percent. BIS Review 90/2008 3 futures markets  only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term. Although the inflationary effect of rising oil and agricultural commodity prices is evident in the retail prices of energy and food  the extent to which the high prices of oil and other raw materials have been passed through to the prices of non-energy  non-food finished goods and services seems thus far to have been limited. But with businesses facing persistently higher input prices  they may attempt to pass through such costs into prices of final goods and services more aggressively than they have so far. Moreover  as the foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined  rises in import prices have put greater upward pressure on business costs and consumer prices. In their economic projections for the June FOMC meeting  monetary policy makers marked up their forecasts for inflation during 2008 as a whole. FOMC participants continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010  as slower global growth leads to a cooling of commodity markets  as pressures on resource utilization decline  and as longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. However  in light of the persistent escalation of commodity prices in recent quarters  FOMC participants viewed the inflation outlook as unusually uncertain and cited the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise as an important risk to the inflation forecast. Moreover  the currently high level of inflation  if sustained  might lead the public to revise up its expectations for longer-term inflation. If that were to occur  and those revised expectations were to become embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process  we could see an unwelcome rise in actual inflation over the longer term. A critical responsibility of monetary policy makers is to prevent that process from taking hold. At present  accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policy makers. The possibility of higher energy prices  tighter credit conditions  and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth. At the same time  upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately  as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pickup in inflation and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher. Given the high degree of uncertainty  monetary policy makers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth. In light of the increase in upside inflation risk  we must be particularly alert to any indications  such as an erosion of longer-term inflation expectations  that the inflationary impulses from commodity prices are becoming embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process. I would like to conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on some of the Federal Reserve's actions in the area of consumer protection. At the time of our report last February  I described the Board's proposal to adopt comprehensive new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market  using our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994. After reviewing the more-than 4 500 comment letters we received on the proposed rules  the Board approved the final rules yesterday. The new rules apply to all types of mortgage lenders and will establish lending standards aimed at curbing abuses while preserving responsible subprime lending and sustainable homeownership. The final rules prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments and require lenders to verify the income and assets on which they rely when making the credit decision. Also  for higher- priced loans  lenders now will be required to establish escrow accounts so that property taxes and insurance costs will be included in consumers' regular monthly payments. The final rules also prohibit prepayment penalties for higher-priced loans in cases in which the consumer's payment can increase during the first few years and restrict prepayment penalties on other higher-priced loans Other measures address the coercion of appraisers  servicer practices  and other issues. We believe the new rules will help to restore confidence in the mortgage market. 4 BIS Review 90/2008 In May  working jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration  the Board issued proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive practices for credit card accounts and overdraft protection plans. Credit cards provide a convenient source of credit for many consumers  but the terms of credit card loans have become more complex  which has reduced transparency. Our consumer testing has persuaded us that disclosures alone cannot solve this problem. Thus  the Board's proposed rules would require card issuers to alter their practices in ways that will allow consumers to better understand how their own decisions and actions will affect their costs. Card issuers would be prohibited from increasing interest rates retroactively to cover prior purchases except under very limited circumstances. For accounts having multiple interest rates  when consumers seek to pay down their balance by paying more than the minimum  card issuers would be prohibited from maximizing interest charges by applying excess payments to the lowest rate balance first. The proposed rules dealing with bank overdraft services seek to give consumers greater control by ensuring that they have ample opportunity to opt out of automatic payments of overdrafts. The Board has already received more than 20 000 comment letters in response to the proposed rules. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions. BIS Review 90/2008 5
