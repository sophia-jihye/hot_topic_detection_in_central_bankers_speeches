  Janet L Yellen: Normalizing monetary policy – prospects and 
perspectives 
Speech  by  Ms  Janet  L  Yellen,  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System,  at  “The  New  Normal  Monetary  Policy,”  research  conference  sponsored  by  the 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, San Francisco, 27 March 2015. 
 I  would  like  to  thank  President Williams  for  his  kind  introduction  and  the  Federal  Reserve 
Bank  of  San  Francisco  for  inviting  me  to  what  promises  to  be  a  very  stimulating  and 
important conference. 
As you know, last week the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) changed its forward 
guidance  pertaining  to  the  federal  funds  rate.  With  continued  improvement  in  economic 
conditions, an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year. 
Of course, the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and its subsequent path 
will  be  determined  by  the  Committee  in  light  of  incoming  data  on  labor  market  conditions, 
inflation, and other aspects of the current expansion. 
In  my  remarks  today  I  will  discuss  some  factors  that  will  likely  guide  our  decisions  as  we 
adjust the stance of monetary policy over time. I will also discuss why most of my colleagues 
and I believe the return of the federal funds rate to a more normal level is likely to be gradual. 
In  doing  so,  I  will  address  three  questions.  First,  why  does  the  Committee  judge  that  an 
increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  target  is  likely  to  become  appropriate  later  this  year? 
Second,  how  are  economic  and  financial  considerations  likely  to  shape  the  course  of 
monetary policy over the next several years? And, finally, are there special risks and other 
considerations that policymakers should take into account in the current environment? 
Current economic conditions and the outlook 
Before turning to these questions, however, let me first review  where the economy is now 
and where it’s likely headed – a necessary backdrop for understanding why, after more than 
six years of maintaining a near-zero federal funds rate and accumulating a large portfolio of 
longer-term  securities,  the  Committee  is  now  giving  serious  consideration  to  beginning  to 
reduce later this year some of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation currently in 
place. 
Although  the  recovery  of  the  labor  market  from  the  deep  recession  following  the  financial 
crisis was frustratingly slow for quite a long time, progress has been more rapid of late. The 
unemployment  rate  has  fallen  markedly  over  the  past  few  years  and  now  stands  at 
5.5 percent,  down  from  10  percent  at  its  peak.  Payroll  gains  have  averaged  275,000  per 
month  over  the  past  year,  well  above  the  pace  needed  to  sustain  further  declines  in  the 
unemployment  rate.  Of  course,  we  still  have  some  way  to  go  to  reach  our  maximum 
employment  goal.  The  unemployment  rate  has  not  yet  declined  to  the  5.0  to  5.2  percent 
range that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer run. Involuntary 
part-time employment remains high by historical standards. Labor force participation is still 
somewhat  lower  than  I  would  expect  after  accounting  for  demographic  trends.1  And  wage

  growth continues to be quite subdued. But I think we can all agree that the recovery in the 
labor market has been substantial. 
I  am  cautiously  optimistic  that,  in  the  context  of  moderate  growth  in  aggregate  output  and 
spending,  labor  market  conditions  are  likely  to  improve  further  in  coming  months.  In 
particular, and despite the somewhat disappointing tone of the recent retail sales data, I think 
consumer  spending  is  likely  to  expand  at  a  good  clip  this  year  given  such  robust 
fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower energy prices, 
continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of consumer confidence. 
Of course, not all sectors of the economy are doing as well: dollar appreciation appears to be 
restraining  net  exports,  low  oil  prices  are  prompting  a  cutback  in  drilling  activity,  and  the 
recovery in residential construction remains subdued. But overall, I anticipate that real gross 
domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster than its potential in coming quarters, 
thereby promoting further gains in employment and declines in the unemployment rate. 
In assessing the actual strength of the labor market and the broader economy, we must bear 
in  mind  that  these  very  welcome  improvements  have  been  achieved  in  the  context  of 
extraordinary monetary accommodation. While the overall level of real activity now appears 
to  be  much  closer  to  its  potential  than  it  was  a  year  or  two  ago,  the  economy  in  an 
“underlying” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the simple reason that the 
increases in hiring and output that have been achieved thus far have required exceptionally 
low levels of short- and longer-term interest rates, reflecting a highly accommodative stance 
of  monetary  policy.  Interest  rates  have  been,  and  remain,  very  low,  and  if  underlying 
conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming. As I will discuss 
shortly,  this  assessment  concerning  the  underlying  strength  of  real  activity  has  important 
policy implications. 
While there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of our dual 
mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent. Inflation as measured 
by  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  has  been  running  below  the 
FOMC’s  longer-run  goal  of  2  percent  for  a  number  of  years,  and  on  a  12-month  basis  is 
currently  1/4  percent.  Some  of  the  weakness  in  inflation  likely  reflects  continuing  slack  in 
labor and product markets. However, much of this weakness stems from the sharp decline in 
the price of oil and other one-time factors that, in the FOMC’s judgment, are likely to have 
only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that inflation expectations remain well 
anchored. 
In this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of longer-run 
inflation expectations. And although market-based measures of inflation compensation have 
declined  appreciably  since  last  summer  and  bear  close  watching,  I  suspect  that  these 
declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market factors that I expect to 
prove transitory. On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for monetary policy to remain 
accommodative  for  some  time,  fostering  an  environment  of  tightening  labor  and  product 
markets  that,  together  with  stable  inflation  expectations,  will  help  move  inflation  up  to 
2 percent over the medium term. 
Why might an increase in the federal funds rate be warranted later this year? 
The  Committee’s  decision  about  when  to  begin  reducing  accommodation  will  depend 
importantly on how economic conditions actually evolve over time. Like most of my FOMC 
colleagues, I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect that conditions 
may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this year. So let me spell 
out the reasoning that underpins this view.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  I would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing considerable 
economic stimulus. The near-zero setting for the federal funds rate has facilitated a sizable 
reduction in labor market slack over the past two years and appears to be consistent with 
further substantial gains. A modest increase in the federal funds rate would be highly unlikely 
to halt this progress, although such an increase might slow its pace somewhat. 
Second, we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of monetary 
policy are felt only after long lags. This means that policymakers cannot wait until they have 
achieved  their  objectives  to  begin  adjusting  policy.  I  would  not  consider  it  prudent  to 
postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the verge of reaching, 
our  inflation  objective.  Doing  so  would  create  too  great  a  risk  of  significantly  overshooting 
both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and 2 percent inflation, potentially 
undermining  economic  growth  and  employment  if  the  FOMC  is  subsequently  forced  to 
tighten  policy  markedly  or  abruptly.  In  addition,  holding  rates  too  low  for  too  long  could 
encourage  inappropriate  risk-taking  by  investors,  potentially  undermining  the  stability  of 
financial  markets.  That  said,  we  must  be  reasonably  confident  at  the  time  of  the  first  rate 
increase  that  inflation  will  move  up  over  time  to our  2  percent  objective,  and  that  such  an 
action will not impede continued solid growth in employment and output. 
An  important  factor  working  to  increase  my  confidence  in  the  inflation  outlook  will  be 
continued  improvement  in  the  labor  market.  A  substantial  body  of  theory,  informed  by 
considerable  historical  evidence,  suggests  that  inflation  will  eventually  begin  to  rise  as 
resource utilization continues to tighten.2 It is largely for this reason that a significant pickup 
in incoming readings on core inflation will not be a precondition for me to judge that an initial 
increase  in  the federal funds  rate  would  be  warranted. With  respect to wages,  I anticipate 
that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick up to a rate more in line  with 
trend  labor  productivity  growth  as  employment settles  in  at  its  maximum  sustainable  level. 
We  could  see  nominal  wage  growth  eventually  running  notably  higher  than  the  current 
roughly 2 percent pace. But the outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation 
does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected. 
For example, we cannot be sure about the future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be 
sure about other factors, such as global competition, the nature of technological change, and 
trends in unionization, that may also influence the pace of real wage growth over time. These 
factors,  which  are  outside  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  control,  likely  explain  why  real  wages 
have  failed  to  keep  pace  with  productivity  growth  for  at  least  the  past  15  years.  For  such 
reasons, we can never be sure what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable 
consumer  price  inflation,  and  this  uncertainty  limits  the  usefulness  of  wage  trends  as  an 
indicator of the Fed’s progress in achieving its inflation objective. 
I  have  argued  that  a  pickup  in  neither  wage  nor  price  inflation  is  indispensable  for  me  to 
achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time. That said, 
I  would  be  uncomfortable  raising  the  federal  funds  rate  if  readings  on  wage  growth,  core 
consumer  prices,  and  other  indicators  of  underlying  inflation  pressures  were  to  weaken,  if 
market-based  measures  of  inflation  compensation  were  to  fall  appreciably  further,  or  if 
survey-based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.

NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau 
of  Economic  Research,  August).  In  addition,  the  apparent  lack  of  disinflationary  pressure  seen  during  the 
recent  recession  is  not  necessarily  a  puzzle  for  the  New  Keynesian  Phillips  curve,  as  shown  in  Marco  Del 
Negro,  Marc  P.  Giannoni,  and  Frank  Schorfheide  (2015),  “Inflation  in  the  Great  Recession  and  New 
Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (January), pp. 168–96.

  Under  normal  circumstances,  simple  monetary  policy  rules,  such  as  the  one  proposed  by 
John  Taylor,  could  help  us  decide  when  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate.3  Even  with  core 
inflation running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, Taylor’s rule now calls for the 
federal funds rate to be well above zero if the unemployment rate is currently judged to be 
close  to  its  normal  longer-run  level  and  the  “normal”  level  of  the  real  federal  funds  rate  is 
currently  close  to  its  historical  average.  But  the  prescription  offered  by  the  Taylor  rule 
changes significantly if one instead assumes, as I do, that appreciable slack still remains in 
the labor market, and that the economy’s equilibrium real federal funds rate – that is, the real 
rate  consistent  with  the  economy  achieving  maximum  employment  and  price  stability  over 
the medium term – is currently quite low by historical standards.4 Under assumptions that I 
consider more realistic under present circumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds 
rate to be close to zero.5 Moreover, I would assert that simple rules are, well, too simple, and 
ignore  important  complexities  of  the  current  situation,  about  which  I  will  have  more  to  say 
shortly. 
The FOMC will, of course, carefully deliberate about when to begin the process of removing 
policy accommodation. But the significance of this decision should not be overemphasized, 
because  what  matters  for  financial  conditions  and  the  broader  economy  is  the  entire 
expected path of short-term interest rates and not the precise timing of the first rate increase. 
The spending and investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence depend primarily on 
expectations  of  policy  well  into  the  future,  as  embedded  in  longer-term  interest  rates  and 
other asset prices. More important than the timing of the Committee’s initial policy move will 
be  the  strategy  the  Committee  deploys  in  adjusting  the  federal  funds  rate  over  time,  in 
response  to  economic  developments,  to  achieve  its  dual  mandate.  Market  participants’ 
perceptions of that reaction function and the implications for the likely longer-run trajectory of 
short-term  interest  rates  will  influence  the  borrowing  costs  faced  by  households  and 
businesses, including the rates on corporate bonds, auto loans, and home mortgages. 
                                                
3   For the original exposition of the Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion Versus Policy Rules in 
Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39, pp. 195–214. For a discussion of 
policy  rules  in  general,  see  John  B.  Taylor  and  John  C.  Williams  (2010),  “Simple  and  Robust  Rules  for 
Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, 
vol. 3B (San Diego: Elsevier), pp. 829–59. 
4   The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the short-term interest rate, less inflation, estimated 
to  be  consistent  with  maximum  employment  and  stable  inflation  in  the  long  run,  assuming  no  future 
disturbances to the economy. Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as independent of the 
cyclical  disturbances  that  routinely  buffet  the  economy,  on  the  assumption  that  the  influences  of  such 
disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, 
however, the U.S. economy has been subject to various adjustment processes that are unusually drawn out 
by  historical  standards,  such  as  the  ongoing  repair  of  household  balance  sheets  and  other  persistent 
headwinds.  These  atypical  processes  imply  that,  in  determining  the  appropriate  stance  of  monetary  policy 
over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow-moving influences on both 
aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening episodes. For this 
reason, it is useful to think of the equilibrium real rate in present circumstances as not only time-varying but 
also having a predictable element that evolves over the medium term. 
5   For example, the Taylor rule is Rt
 = RR* + πt + 0.5(πt –2) + 0.5Yt, where R denotes the federal funds rate, RR* 
is  the  estimated  value  of  the  equilibrium  real  rate,  π  is  the  current  inflation  rate  (usually  measured 
using a core consumer  price index),  and  Y is  the  output gap.  The  latter can  be  approximated  using  Okun’s 
law, Yt = –2 (Ut – U*) , where U is the unemployment rate and U* is the natural rate of unemployment. If RR* is 
assumed  to  equal  2  percent  (roughly  the  average  historical  value  of  the  real  federal  funds  rate)  and  U*  is 
assumed to equal 5-1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a bit below 
3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1–1/4 percent and the unemployment 
rate  is 5.5 percent.  But if  RR*  is instead  assumed  to  equal  0 percent currently  (as some  statistical  models 
suggest)  and  U*  is  assumed  to  equal  5  percent  (an  estimate  in  line  with  many  FOMC  participants’  SEP 
projections), then the rule’s current prescription is less than 1/2 percent.

How are economic and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary 
policy over the next several years? 
Let me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier: How are economic and financial 
considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next few years? Let me 
first  be  clear  that  the  FOMC  does  not  intend  to  embark  on  any  predetermined  course  of 
tightening  following  an  initial  decision  to  raise  the  funds  rate  target  range  –  one  that,  for 
example,  would  involve  similarly  sized  rate  increases  at  every  meeting  or  on  some  other 
schedule.  Rather,  the  actual  path  of  policy  will  evolve  as  economic  conditions  evolve,  and 
policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or even reverse course depending on 
actual  and  expected  developments  in  real  activity  and  inflation.  Reflecting  such  data 
dependence,  as  well  as  some  historically  unusual  policy  considerations  that  I  will  discuss 
shortly,  the  average  pace  of  tightening  observed  during  previous  recoveries  could  well 
provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few 
years. Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate over time will be to achieve and sustain 
economic  conditions  close  to  maximum  employment  with  inflation  averaging  around 
2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the inevitable twists and turns of the economy. 
Keeping  in  mind  the  all-important  proviso  that  policy  is  never  predetermined  but  is  always 
data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy, assuming the most 
likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors? The answer is that it depends, 
of  course,  on  one’s  outlook  for  the  economy.  Today  I  will  focus  on  the  modal  outlook 
presented  by  FOMC  participants’  submissions  to  the  March  Summary  of  Economic 
Projections  (SEP),  which  assumes  that  no  further  unanticipated  disturbances  buffet  the 
economy. As I noted at my press conference after last week’s FOMC meeting, participants 
generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through late 2017 to levels 
at or somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level, accompanied by growth 
in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its estimated longer-run trend with 
inflation moving up to around 2 percent. This solid economic performance is projected to be 
consistent with a gradual normalization of monetary policy: The median funds rate projection 
in  the  March  SEP  increases  a  percentage  point  per  year  on  average  through  the  end  of 
2017. 
The projected combination of a gradual rise in the nominal federal funds rate coupled with 
further progress on both legs of the dual mandate is consistent with an implicit assessment 
by  the  Committee  that  the  equilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate  –  one  measure  of  the 
economy’s underlying strength – is rising only slowly over time. In the wake of the financial 
crisis,  the  equilibrium  real  rate  apparently  fell  well  below  zero  because  of  numerous 
persistent headwinds. These headwinds include tighter underwriting standards and restricted 
access  to  some  forms  of  credit;  the  need  for  households  to  reduce  their  debt  burdens; 
contractionary  fiscal  policy  at  all  levels  of  government  after  the  initial  effects  of  the  fiscal 
stimulus  package  had  passed;  and  elevated  uncertainty  about  the  economic  outlook  that 
made firms hesitant to invest and hire, and households reluctant to buy houses, cars, and 
other discretionary goods. 
Fortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished considerably 
over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably even as the level of 
the federal funds  rate  and  the  volume  of  our  asset  holdings  remained  nearly  unchanged.6 
                                                
6   Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this type of 
unconventional  monetary  policy  action  depends  primarily  on  the  stock  of  longer-term  assets  held  by  the 
Federal  Reserve,  not  the  flow  of  securities  bought.  Because  the  FOMC  has  held  the  size  of  the  Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero, the 
overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period. However, the downward pressure on 
long-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time, particularly after 
the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the assets held in the

  Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been gradually improving, and the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate has been gradually rising. Although the recent appreciation 
of  the  dollar  is  likely  to  weigh  on  U.S.  exports  over  time,  I  nonetheless  anticipate  further 
diminution of the headwinds just noted over the next couple of years, and as the equilibrium 
real funds rate continues to rise, it will accordingly be appropriate to raise the actual level of 
the real federal funds rate in tandem, all else being equal.7 At present, the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate,  which  by  some  estimates  is currently  close  to  zero, appears to  be  well 
below the longer-run normal levels assessed by the FOMC. The median SEP estimate of this 
longer-run  normal  rate  –  that  is,  the  long-run  projection  of  the  nominal  funds  rate  less 
2 percent inflation – stood at 1–3/4 percent in the FOMC’s recent projections.8 Provided that 
inflation  shows  clear  signs  over  time  of  moving  up  toward  2  percent  in  the  context  of 
continuing  progress  toward  maximum  employment,  I  therefore  expect  that  a  further 
tightening  in  monetary  policy  after  the  first  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be 
warranted. Should incoming data, however, fail to support this forecast, then the actual path 
of policy will need to be adjusted appropriately. 
Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take into 
account in the current environment? 
As I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual rise in the 
federal  funds  rate  will  be  appropriate  over  the  next  few  years,  conditional  on  our  baseline 
forecasts for real activity, inflation, and other aspects of the economy’s performance. So far 
in my remarks, I have emphasized one key rationale for such a judgment – namely, that the 
equilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate  is  at  present  well  below  its  historical  average  and  is 
anticipated to rise only gradually over time as the various headwinds that have restrained the 
economic recovery continue to abate. If incoming data support such a forecast, the federal 
funds rate should be normalized, but at a gradual pace. 
Several additional factors reinforce this conclusion, and that brings me to my third question: 
Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take into account 
in the current environment? Keeping in mind that the actual course of monetary policy in the 
future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three additional considerations 
that are relevant.9 
                                                                                                                                                   
portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock of publicly held debt 
will be shrinking. 
If  resource  utilization  was  at  a  normal  level  and  inflation  was  equal  to  2  percent,  policymakers  would 
presumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those 
conditions.  Accordingly,  if  the  equilibrium  rate  is  rising  over  time,  the  “neutral”  setting  of  monetary  policy 
should be rising in tandem.

8   For  example,  the  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  real  rate  from  the  Laubach-Williams  model  for  2014:Q4  is 
negative 0.16. For information on the model, see Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003), “Measuring 
the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp.1063–70; updated 
estimates  of  the  baseline  model  are  available  on  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  San  Francisco  website  at

Another  recent  study,  however,  concludes  that  the  equilibrium  real  rate  is  probably  in  the  range  of  1  to 
2 percent  while  also  emphasizing  that  estimates  in  this  area  are  quite  imprecise;  see  James  D.  Hamilton, 
Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West (2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate: Past, Present, 
and Future (PDF),” working paper (San Diego: University of California at San Diego, March). 
  Note that the concept of the equilibrium real rate used in the latter study is explicitly long-run in nature and so 
excludes  the  effects  of  forces  that  have  persistently  restrained  the  pace  of  the  current  expansion  but  are 
expected  to  eventually  fade  away,  such  as  household  balance  sheet  repair;  for  this  reason,  the  paper’s 
estimate is higher than the medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate discussed in the speech. 
In principle, the three considerations – uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, 
the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and the potential benefits 
of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer-run rate – should influence

  The first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding back growth 
are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the equilibrium real federal 
funds  rate  may  not,  in  fact,  recover  as  much  or  as  quickly  as  I  anticipate.  Substantial 
uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest rate, and, as I will discuss 
momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly pessimistic about the odds that it will rise 
significantly  over  time.  Moreover,  some  recent  studies  have  raised  the  prospect  that  the 
economies of the United States and other countries will grow more slowly in the future as a 
result of both demographic factors and a slower pace of productivity gains from technological 
advances.  At  an  extreme,  such  developments  could  even  amount  to  a  type  of  “secular 
stagnation,” in which monetary policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite 
low relative to historical norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly 
expansive fiscal policy.10 
Such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when the ability 
of  the  economy  to  adjust  to  significant  rate  increases  will  be  especially  uncertain.  The 
experience of Japan over the past 20 years, and Sweden more recently, demonstrates that a 
tightening  of  policy  when  the  equilibrium  real  rate  remains  low  can  result  in  appreciable 
economic  costs,  delaying  the  attainment  of  a  central  bank’s  price  stability  objective. 
International  experience  therefore  counsels  caution  in  removing  accommodation  until  the 
Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will continue to expand in line with its 
expectations – a view that is also supported by the research literature.11 
A second reason for the Committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy accommodation 
relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the vicinity of the zero lower 
bound.  In  the  event  that  growth  in  employment  and  overall  activity  proves  unexpectedly 
robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent objective, the FOMC can and will 
raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation. But if growth was to falter and inflation was 
to  fall  yet  further,  the  effective  lower  bound  on  nominal  interest  rates  could  limit  the 
Committee’s ability to provide the needed degree of accommodation. With an already large 
balance sheet, for example, the FOMC might be concerned about potential costs and risks 
associated with further asset purchases. 
                                                                                                                                                   
both  the  timing  of  the  onset  of  policy  normalization  and  the  subsequent  pace  at  which  that  normalization 
proceeds. And in fact, I view all three considerations as helping to explain why the FOMC has held the federal 
funds rate near zero for so long. I also view such considerations as consistent with a likely increase in the 
target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a broader strategy for only 
gradually  reducing  accommodation  over  time  (subject,  of  course,  to  adjustments  in  response  to  incoming 
information on real activity, inflation, and other factors). 
10   The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H. Hansen (1938), “The 
Consequences  of  Reducing  Expenditures,”  Proceedings  of  the  Academy  of  Political  Science,  vol.  17 
(January),  pp. 60–72;  and  Alvin  H.  Hansen  (1939),  “Economic  Progress  and  Declining Population  Growth,” 
American  Economic  Review,  vol.  29  (March),  pp.  1–15.  This  possibility,  and  its  applicability  to  the  United 
States  and  other  developed  economies  in  coming  years,  has  received  considerable  attention  of  late;  see

University  of  Chicago  Press);  and  Lawrence  H.  Summers  (2014),  “U.S.  Economic  Prospects:  Secular 
Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics, vol. 49 (April), pp. 65–73. For a 
more skeptical assessment of the secular stagnation hypothesis, see Hamilton and others, “The Equilibrium 
Real Funds Rate,” in note 8. 
11   A  number of studies  have  shown,  using model simulations,  that  policymakers  can  improve  macroeconomic 
performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to changes in economic 
conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain. For a survey of the literature on this 
issue, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust Rules for Monetary Policy,” in 
Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego: 
Elsevier), pp. 829–59.

  Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming constrained 
by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the more severe 
the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current policy should lean 
in  accommodative  direction.12  In  effect,  such  a  strategy  represents  insurance  against  the 
zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and a faster rise in inflation 
under the modal outlook. Given the modal outlook envisioned in FOMC participants’ recent 
forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation 
moving back up to 2 percent over the next few years, the risk that the funds rate would need 
to  return  to  near  zero  should  be  declining  appreciably.  Consistent  with  this  assessment, 
almost  all  FOMC  participants  now  view  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  real  activity  as  largely 
balanced, although some also see inflation risks as weighted to the downside. 
That said, it is sobering to note that many market participants appear to assess the risks to 
the outlook quite differently. For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers in 
late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the funds rate would 
fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13 In addition, both the remarkably low level 
of long-term government bond yields in advanced economies and the low prevailing level of 
inflation compensation suggest that financial market participants may hold more pessimistic 
views  than  FOMC  participants  concerning  the  risks  to  the  global  outlook.  Since  long-term 
yields reflect the market’s probability-weighted average of all possible short-term interest rate 
paths, along with compensating term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in 
advanced economies suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios 
that would necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in 
participants’ modal SEP projections.14 
A final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of achieving a prompt 
return  of  inflation  to  the  FOMC’s  2  percent  goal,  an  objective  that  would  be  advanced  by 
allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat below estimates of its longer-
run  sustainable  level.  To  a  limited  degree,  such  an  outcome  is  envisioned  in  many 
participants’  most  recent  SEP  projections.  A  tight  labor  market  may  also  work  to  reverse 
some of the adverse supply-side developments resulting from the financial crisis. The deep 
recession and slow recovery likely have held back investment in physical and human capital, 
restrained the rate of new business formation, prompted discouraged workers to leave the 
labor force, and eroded the skills of the long-term unemployed.15 Some of these effects might

Bound  on  Nominal  Interest  Rates,”  Journal  of  Monetary  Economics,  vol.  54  (3),  728–52;  Taisuke  Nakata

14   Of course, low long-term yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessimism about U.S. economic 
prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in persistent upward 
pressure  on  the dollar,  thereby  putting  downward  pressure on  U.S.  net exports,  employment, inflation,  and 
thus short-term interest rates. On a closely related issue concerning evidence that investors’ perceptions of 
the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in recent months, see Justin Wolfers 
(2015), “A Prediction Market for Inflation, or Deflation,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 110 (December),

  importance  of 
the  quantitative 
be  reversed  in  a  tight  labor  market,  yielding  long-term  benefits  associated  with  a  more 
productive  economy.  That  said, 
these  supply-side 
mechanisms are difficult to establish, and the relevant research on this point is quite limited. 
Of course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks. Proceeding too slowly to tighten 
policy  could  have  adverse  consequences  for  the  attainment  of  the  Committee’s  inflation 
objective  over  time,  especially  if  it  were  to  undermine  the  FOMC’s  inflation  credibility. 
Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which high levels of unemployment 
place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but tight labor markets generate marked 
upward pressure. If so, a decline in unemployment below its natural rate could cause inflation 
to  quickly  rise  to  an  undesirably  high  level.  Rapid  increases  in  short-term  interest  rates  to 
arrest  such  an  unwelcome  development  could,  in  turn,  have  adverse  effects  on  financial 
markets and the broader economy. 
Proceeding  too  cautiously  could  also  have  undesirable  effects  on  financial  stability.  An 
environment  of  prolonged  low  short-term  rates  could  prompt  an  excessive  buildup  in 
leverage  or  cause  underwriting  standards  to  erode  as  investors  take  on  risks  they  cannot 
measure or manage appropriately in a reach for yield.16 At this point the evidence indicates 
that  such  vulnerabilities  do  not  pose  a  significant  threat,  but  the  Committee  is  carefully 
monitoring  developments  in  this  area.17  Moreover,  in  my  view,  macroprudential  regulatory 
and supervisory tools should serve as our first line of defense in addressing these risks.18 
Conclusion 
To conclude, let me emphasize that in determining when to initially increase its target range 
for the federal funds rate and how to adjust it thereafter, the Committee’s decisions will be 
data  dependent,  reflecting  evolving  judgments  concerning  the  implications  of  incoming 
information for the economic outlook. We cannot be certain about the underlying strength of 
the  expansion,  the  maximum  level  of  employment  consistent  with  price  stability,  or  the 
longer-run level of interest rates consistent with maximum employment. Policy must adjust as 
our understanding of these factors changes. However, if conditions do evolve in the manner 
that most of my FOMC  colleagues and I anticipate, I would expect the level of the federal 
funds  rate  to  be  normalized  only  gradually,  reflecting  the  gradual  diminution  of  headwinds 
from  the  financial  crisis  and  the  balance  of  risks  I  have  enumerated  of  moving  either  too 
slowly or too quickly. Nothing about the course of the Committee’s actions is predetermined 
except the Committee’s commitment to promote our dual mandate of maximum employment 
and price stability.
