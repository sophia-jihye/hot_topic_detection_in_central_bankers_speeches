Ben S Bernanke: Brief overview of the 4th Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy (welcoming remarks) Welcoming remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Fourth Conference of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy  Washington DC  1 December 2006. Vice President Papademos  ladies and gentlemen  I would like to welcome you to the fourth conference of the International Research Forum for Monetary Policy. The forum is one outgrowth of the increased interaction between central banks and academic institutions that  in my opinion  benefits both groups. It is a true joint effort involving the European Central Bank  the Federal Reserve Board  the BMW Institute for German and European Studies at Georgetown University  and the Centre for Financial Studies at Goethe University in Frankfurt. You have a very full agenda for the next two days. The topics represent a good mix of theoretical work as well as empirical work based on both calibration and econometric estimation. You are beginning with two papers that emphasize the importance of inflation expectations. Other papers examine such topics as the application of search theory  the functioning of mortgage markets  the theoretical analysis of optimal monetary policy  and empirical research on price-setting. There is a lot of intellectual food on the table. Bon appetit! BIS Review 118/2006 1
