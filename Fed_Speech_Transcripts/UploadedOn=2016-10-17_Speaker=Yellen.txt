Janet Yellen: Macroeconomic research after the crisis Speech by Ms Janet L Yellen  Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at “The Elusive 'Great' Recovery: Causes and Implications for Future Business Cycle Dynamics” 60th annual economic conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston  Boston  Massachusetts  14 October 2016. Watch live: www.bostonfed.org/live Extreme economic events have often challenged existing views of how the economy works and exposed shortcomings in the collective knowledge of economists. To give two well-known examples  both the Great Depression and the stagflation of the 1970s motivated new ways of thinking about economic phenomena. More recently  the financial crisis and its aftermath might well prove to be a similar sort of turning point. Today I would like to reflect on some ways in which the events of the past few years have revealed limits in economists’ understanding of the economy and suggest several important questions I hope the profession will try to answer. Some of these questions are not new  though recent events have made them more urgent. Appropriately  some are addressed by the papers prepared for this conference. Pursuing answers to these questions is vital to the work of Federal Reserve and other economic policymakers  and the Fed is likewise engaged in ongoing research to seek answers. The Influence of Demand on Aggregate Supply The first question I would like to pose concerns the distinction between aggregate supply and aggregate demand: Are there circumstances in which changes in aggregate demand can have an appreciable  persistent effect on aggregate supply? Prior to the Great Recession  most economists would probably have answered this question with a qualified “no.” They would have broadly agreed with Robert Solow that economic output over the longer term is primarily driven by supply—the amount of output of goods and services the economy is capable of producing  given its labor and capital resources and existing technologies. Aggregate demand  in contrast  was seen as explaining shorter-term fluctuations around the mostly exogenous supply-determined longer-run trend. This conclusion deserves to be reconsidered in light of the failure of the level of economic activity to return to its pre-recession trend in most advanced economies. This post-crisis experience suggests that changes in aggregate demand may have an appreciable  persistent effect on aggregate supply—that is  on 2 potential output. 1 3 The idea that persistent shortfalls in aggregate demand could adversely affect the supply side of the economy—an effect commonly referred to as hysteresis—is not new; for example  the possibility was discussed back in the mid-1980s with regard to the performance of European labor markets. But interest in the topic has increased in light of the persistent slowdown in economic growth seen in many developed economies since the crisis. Several recent studies present cross-country evidence indicating that severe and persistent recessions have historically had these sorts of long-term effects  even for downturns that appear to have resulted largely or entirely from a shock to aggregate demand. With regard to the U.S. experience  one study estimates that the level of potential output is now 7 percent below what would have been expected based on its pre-crisis trajectory  and it argues that much of this supply-side damage is attributable to several developments that likely occurred as a result of the deep recession and slow recovery. In particular  the study finds that in the wake of the crisis  the United States experienced a modest reduction in labor supply as a result of reduced immigration and a fall in labor force participation beyond what can be explained by cyclical conditions and demographic factors  as well as a marked slowdown in the estimated trend growth rate of labor productivity. 4 5 1 / 12 BIS central bankers' speeches The latter likely reflects an unusually slow pace of business capital accumulation since the crisis and  more conjecturally  the sharp decline in spending on research and development and the 6 very slow pace of new firm formation in recent years. If we assume that hysteresis is in fact present to some degree after deep recessions  the natural next question is to ask whether it might be possible to reverse these adverse supply-side effects by temporarily running a “high-pressure economy ” with robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market. One can certainly identify plausible ways in which this might occur. Increased business sales would almost certainly raise the productive capacity of the economy by encouraging additional capital spending  especially if accompanied by reduced uncertainty about future prospects. In addition  a tight labor market might draw in potential workers who would otherwise sit on the sidelines and encourage job-to-job transitions that could also lead to more- efficient—and  hence  more-productive—job matches. Finally  albeit more speculatively  strong demand could potentially yield significant productivity gains by  among other things  prompting higher levels of research and development spending and increasing the incentives to start new  innovative businesses. 7 Hysteresis effects—and the possibility they might be reversed—could have important implications for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. For example  hysteresis would seem to make it even more important for policymakers to act quickly and aggressively in response to a recession  because doing so would help to reduce the depth and persistence of the downturn  thereby limiting the supply-side damage that might otherwise ensue. In addition  if strong economic conditions can partially reverse supply-side damage after it has occurred  then policymakers may want to aim at being more accommodative during recoveries than would be called for under the traditional view that supply is largely independent of demand. 8 More research is needed  however  to better understand the influence of movements in aggregate demand on aggregate supply. From a policy perspective  we of course need to bear in mind that an accommodative monetary stance  if maintained too long  could have costs that exceed the benefits by increasing the risk of financial instability or undermining price stability. More generally  the benefits and potential costs of pursuing such a strategy remain hard to quantify  and other policies might be better suited to address damage to the supply side of the economy. Heterogeneity My second question asks whether individual differences within broad groups of actors in the economy can influence aggregate economic outcomes—in particular  what effect does such heterogeneity have on aggregate demand? Many macroeconomists work with models where groups of individual actors  such as households or firms  are treated as a single “representative” agent whose behavior stands in for that of the group as a whole. For example  rather than explicitly modeling and then adding up the separate actions of a large number of different households  a macro model might instead assume that the behavior of a single “average” household can describe the aggregate behavior of all households. Prior to the financial crisis  these so-called representative-agent models were the dominant paradigm for analyzing many macroeconomic questions. However  a disaggregated approach seems needed to understand some key aspects of the Great Recession. To give one example  consider the effects of negative housing equity on consumption. Although households typically reduce their spending in response to wealth declines  the many households whose equity positions in their homes were actually drivennegative by the reduction in house prices may have curtailed their spending even more sharply because of a markedly reduced ability to borrow. Such a development  in turn  would shift the relationship between housing equity (which 2 / 12 BIS central bankers' speeches remained solidly positive in the aggregate) and consumer spending for the economy as a whole. Such a shift in an aggregate relationship would be difficult to understand or predict without using disaggregated data and models. 9 More generally  studying the effects of household and firm heterogeneity might help us better account for the severity of the recession and the slow recovery. At the household level  recent research finds that heterogeneity can amplify the effects of adverse shocks  a result that is largely driven by households with very little net worth that sharply increase their savings in a recession. At the firm level  there is evidence that financial constraints had a particularly large adverse effect on employment at small firms and the start-up of new firms  factors that may be part of the explanation for the Great Recession’s long duration and the subsequent slow recovery. More generally  if larger firms seeking to expand have better access to credit than smaller ones  overall growth in investment and employment could depend in part on the distribution of sales across different types of businesses. Modeling any of these issues quantitatively will likely require the use of a heterogeneous-agent framework. 10 Economists’ understanding of how changes in fiscal and monetary policy affect the economy might also benefit from the recognition that households and firms are heterogeneous. For example  in simple textbook models of the monetary transmission mechanism  central banks operate largely through the effect of real interest rates on consumption and investment. Once heterogeneity is taken into account  other important channels emerge. For example  spending by many households and firms appears to be quite sensitive to changes in labor income  business sales  or the value of collateral that in turn affects their access to credit—conditions that monetary policy affects only indirectly. Studying monetary models with heterogeneous agents more closely could help us shed new light on these aspects of the monetary transmission mechanism. While the economics profession has long been aware that these issues matter  their effects had 11 been incorporated into macro models only to a very limited extent prior to the financial crisis. I am glad to now see a greater emphasis on the possible macroeconomic consequences of heterogeneity  including in work by economists at the Federal Reserve. Nevertheless  the various linkages between heterogeneity and aggregate demand are not yet well understood  either empirically or theoretically. More broadly  even though the tools of monetary policy are generally not well suited to achieve distributional objectives  it is important for policymakers to understand and monitor the effects of macroeconomic developments on different groups within society. Financial Linkages to the Real Economy 12 My third question concerns a key issue for monetary policy and macroeconomics that is less directly addressed by this conference: How does the financial sector interact with the broader economy? In light of the housing bubble and subsequent events  policymakers clearly need to better understand what kinds of developments contribute to financial crises. What is the relationship between the buildup of excessive leverage and the value of real estate and other types of collateral  and what factors impede or facilitate the deleveraging process that follows? Does the economic fallout from a financial crisis depend on the particulars of the crisis  such as whether it involves widespread damage to household balance sheets? How does the nature and degree of the interconnections between financial firms affect the propagation and amplification of stress through the financial system and overall economy? Finally—and most importantly—what can monetary policy and financial oversight do to reduce the frequency and severity of future crises? Although the scope of these questions extends beyond the themes of this conference  it does include issues that are closely related. Consider the influence of balance sheet conditions and 3 / 12 BIS central bankers' speeches 13 noninterest credit terms on spending and overall activity—an area where it is important to take account of differences across individual households and firms  as I just noted. Research on this topic has  of course  been ongoing for some time  and it has expanded greatly in the wake of the financial crisis. But I believe we have a lot more to learn about the ways in which changes in underwriting standards and other determinants of credit availability interact with interest rates to affect such things as consumer spending  housing demand and home prices  business investment (especially for small firms)  and the formation of new firms. For example  is the persistent increase in the personal saving rate that we have observed since the collapse of the housing bubble primarily a result of a sustained shift toward more prudent underwriting standards by lenders? Is it something that will ultimately prove transitory once householdsfinish repairing their balance sheets or become more confident about their future prospects for employment and income? The answer to thislatter question could have significant implications for the longer-run normal  or neutral  level of interest rates and thus for the conduct of monetary policy. Inflation Dynamics 14 15 My fourth question goes to the heart of monetary policy: What determines inflation? From my perspective  the standard framework for thinking about inflation dynamics used by central bank economists and others prior to the financial crisis remains conceptually useful today. A simple description of this framework might go something like this: Inflation is characterized by an underlying trend that has been essentially constant since the mid-1990s; previously  this trend seemed to drift over time  influenced by actual past inflation or other economic conditions. Theory and evidence suggest that this trend is strongly influenced by inflation expectations that  in turn  depend on monetary policy. In particular  the remarkable stability of various measures of expected inflation in recent years presumably represents the fruits of the Federal Reserve’s sustained efforts since the early 1980s to bring down and then stabilize inflation at a low level. The anchoring of inflation expectations that has resulted from this policy does not  however  prevent actual inflation from fluctuating from year to year in response to the temporary influence of movements in energy prices and other disturbances. In addition  inflation will tend to run above or below its underlying trend to the extent that resource utilization— which may serve as an indicator of firms’ marginal costs—is persistently high or low. 16 17 While this general framework for thinking about the inflation process remains useful  questions about some of its quantitative features have arisen in the wake of the Great Recession and the subsequent slow recovery. For example  the influence of labor market conditions on inflation in recent years seems to be weaker than had been commonly thought prior to the financial crisis. Although inflation fell during the recession  the decline was quite modest given how high unemployment rose; likewise  wages and prices rose comparatively little as the labor market gradually recovered. Whether this reduction in sensitivity was somehow caused by the recession or instead pre-dated it and was merely revealed under extreme conditions is unclear. Either way  the underlying cause is unknown. Does the reduced sensitivity reflect structural changes  such as globalization or a greater role for intangible capital in production that have reduced the importance of cyclical swings in domestic activity for firms’ marginal costs and pricing power? Or does it perhaps reflect the well-documented reluctance—or  alternatively  limited ability—of firms to cut the nominal wages of their employees  which could help to explain the relatively moderate movements in inflation we saw during and after the recession? 18 19 Another gap in our knowledge about the nature of the inflation process concerns expectations. Although many theoretical models suggest that actual inflation should be most closely related to short-run inflation expectations  as an empirical matter  measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data better. Yet another unresolved issue concerns whose expectations —those of consumers  firms  or investors—are most relevant for wage and price setting  a point on which theory provides no clear-cut guidance. More generally  the precise manner in which 20 21 4 / 12 BIS central bankers' speeches expectations influence inflation deserves further study. 21 22 Perhaps most importantly  we need to know more about the manner in which inflation expectations are formed and how monetary policy influences them. Ultimately  both actual and expected inflation are tied to the central bank’s inflation target  whether that target is explicit or implicit. But how does this anchoring process occur? Does a central bank have to keep actual inflation near the target rate for many years before inflation expectations completely conform? Can policymakers instead materially influence inflation expectations directly and quickly by simply announcing their intention to pursue a particular inflation goal in the future? Or does the truth lie somewhere in between  with a change in expectations requiring some combination of clear communications about policymakers’ inflation goal  concrete policy actions to demonstrate their commitment to that goal  and at least some success in moving actual inflation toward its desired level in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the strategy? Although historical experience suggests that changing the public’s inflation expectations would be neither quick nor easy  it is not clear which of these possibilities is correct. 23 With nominal short-term interest rates at or close to their effective lower bound in many countries  the broader question of how expectations are formed has taken on heightened importance. Under such circumstances  many central banks have sought additional ways to stimulate their economies  including adopting policies that are directly aimed at influencing expectations of future interest rates and inflation. The unusually explicit and extended guidance about the likely future path of the federal funds rate that was provided by the FOMC from 2011 through 2014 is an example of such a policy  as is the Bank of Japan’s upward revision to its official inflation objective in 2013. Moreover  these and other expectational strategies may be needed again in the future  given the likelihood that the global economy may continue to experience historically low interest rates  thereby making it unlikely that reductions in short-term interest rates alone would be an adequate response to a future recession. 24 For all of these reasons  I hope that researchers will strive to improve our understanding of inflation dynamics and its interactions with monetary policy. International Linkages Before closing  let me mention one additional area where more study is needed—the effects of changes in U.S. monetary policy on financial and economic conditions in the rest of the world and the ways in which those foreign effects can feed back to influence conditions here at home. Of course  cross-country monetary policy spillovers have been the subject of scholarly debate since the Great Depression  and much of the formal analysis of this topic dates back to the early 1960s. But this issue has received renewed interest with the advent of unconventional monetary policies after the Great Recession and  more recently  the divergence of monetary policies among major advanced-economy central banks. 25 Broadly speaking  monetary policy actions in one country spill over to other economies through three main channels: changes in exchange rates; changes in domestic demand  which alter the economy’s imports; and changes in domestic financial conditions—such as interest rates and asset prices—that  through portfolio balance and other channels  affect financial conditions abroad. Research by Federal Reserve staff suggests that  all told  U.S. monetary policy spillovers to other economies are positive—that is  policies designed to provide stimulus to the U.S. economy also boost activity abroad  as negative effects of dollar depreciation are offset by positive effects of higher U.S. imports and easier foreign financial conditions. However  this issue is far from settled  as are a host of other related questions  including the following: Do U.S. monetary policy actions affect advanced and emerging market countries differently? Do conventional and unconventional monetary policies spill over to other countries differently? And to what extent are U.S. interest rates and financial conditions influenced by easing measures abroad? 26 5 / 12 BIS central bankers' speeches Conclusion In closing  I would like to commend the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for organizing this conference and fostering research and debate on questions vital to our understanding of the economy. Answering these questions will help the Federal Reserve’s efforts to promote a healthy economy  and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today and be part of this important discussion.
