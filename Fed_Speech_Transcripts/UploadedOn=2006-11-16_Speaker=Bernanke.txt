Ben S Bernanke: Monetary aggregates and monetary policy at the Federal Reserve – a historical perspective Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Fourth ECB Central Banking Conference “The role of money: money and monetary policy in the twenty-first century”  Frankfurt am Main  10 November 2006. My topic today is the role of monetary aggregates in economic analysis and monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve. I will take a historical perspective  which will set the stage for a brief discussion of recent practice. The Federal Reserve’s responsibility for managing the money supply was established at its founding in 1913  as the first sentence of the Federal Reserve Act directed the nation’s new central bank "to furnish an elastic currency."1 However  the Federal Reserve met this mandate principally by issuing currency as needed to damp seasonal fluctuations in interest rates  and during its early years the Federal Reserve did not monitor the money stock or even collect monetary data in a systematic way.2 3 The Federal Reserve’s first fifteen years were a period of relative prosperity  but the crash of 1929 ushered in a decade of global financial instability and economic depression. Subsequent scholarship  notably the classic monetary history by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz (1963)  argued that the Federal Reserve’s failure to stabilize the money supply was an important cause of the Great Depression. That view today commands considerable support among economists  although I note that the sources of the Federal Reserve’s policy errors during the Depression went much deeper than a failure to understand the role of money in the economy or the lack of reliable monetary statistics. Policymakers of the 1930s observed the correlates of the monetary contraction  such as deflation and bank failures. However  they questioned not only their own capacity to reverse those developments but also the desirability of doing so. Their hesitancy to act reflected the prevailing view that some purging of the excesses of the 1920s  painful though it might be  was both necessary and inevitable. In any case  the Federal Reserve began to pay more attention to money in the latter part of the 1930s. Central to these efforts was the Harvard economist Lauchlin Currie  whose 1934 treatise  The Supply and Control of Money in the United States  was among the first to provide a practical empirical definition of money. His definition  which included currency and demand deposits  corresponded closely to what we now call M1. Currie argued that collection of monetary data was necessary for the Federal Reserve to control the money supply  which in turn would facilitate the stabilization of the price level and of the economy more generally.4 In 1934  Marriner Eccles asked Currie to join the Treasury Department  and later that year  when Eccles was appointed to head the Federal Reserve  he took Currie with him. Currie’s tenure at the Federal Reserve helped to spark new interest in monetary 1 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1998)  1-001. In his recent history of the Federal Reserve  Allan Meltzer (2003  p. 66) notes of some of the Act’s proponents that: "[o]ne of their principal aims was to increase the seasonal response  or elasticity  of the note issue by eliminating the provisions of the National Banking Act that tied the amount of currency to the stock of government bonds." 3 2 See Mankiw and Miron (1986) for a discussion of the Fed’s seasonal interest-rate smoothing. The Federal Reserve did publish data on the issuance of Federal Reserve notes from its inception. Federal Reserve notes were only part of total currency in circulation  however  the remainder being made up of national bank notes  United States notes  Treasury notes  gold and silver certificates  and gold and silver coin. Beginning in 1915  the Federal Reserve Bulletin included data on currency that had been collected by the Treasury and data on total bank deposits that had been collected by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as a byproduct of its regulatory role  but publication was irregular. Indeed  the Federal Reserve’s adherence to the real bills doctrine - which counseled against active monetary management in favor of supplying money only as required to meet "the needs of trade" - gave the new institution little reason to pay attention to changes in the money stock. See Humphrey (1986) for a history of the real bills doctrine. The constraints of the gold standard also restricted (without entirely precluding) active monetary management by the Federal Reserve. In the second edition of his book  Currie (1935) wrote: "The achievement of desirable objectives … rests entirely upon the effectiveness of control. The achievement  for example  of the objective of a price level varying inversely with the productive efficiency of society demands a highly energetic central banking policy and a high degree of effectiveness of monetary control… Even for the achievement of the more modest objective of lessening business fluctuations by monetary means  the degree of control of the central bank is of paramount importance." (pp. 3-4). 4 BIS Review 110/2006 1 statistics. In 1939  the Federal Reserve began a project to bring together the available historical data on banking and money. This effort culminated in 1943 with the publication of Banking and Monetary Statistics  which included annual figures on demand and time deposits from 1892 and on currency from 1860. Academic interest in monetary aggregates increased after World War II. Milton Friedman’s volume Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money  which contained Phillip Cagan’s work on money and hyperinflation  appeared in 1956  followed in 1960 by Friedman’s A Program for Monetary Stability  which advocated that monetary policy engineer a constant growth rate for the money stock. Measurement efforts also flourished. In 1960  William J. Abbott of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis led a project that resulted in a revamping of the Fed’s money supply statistics  which were subsequently published semimonthly.5 Even in those early years  however  financial innovation posed problems for monetary measurement  as banks introduced new types of accounts that blurred the distinction between transaction deposits and other types of deposits. To accommodate these innovations  alternative definitions of money were created; by 1971  the Federal Reserve published data for five definitions of money  denoted M1 through M5.6 During the early years of monetary measurement  policymakers groped for ways to use the new data.7 However  during the 1960s and 1970s  as researchers and policymakers struggled to understand the sharp increase in inflation  the view that nominal aggregates (including credit as well as monetary aggregates) are closely linked to spending growth and inflation gained ground. In 1966  the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began to add a proviso to its policy directives that bank credit growth should not deviate significantly from projections; a similar proviso about money growth was added in 1970. In 1974  the FOMC began to specify "ranges of tolerance" for the growth of M1 and for the broader M2 monetary aggregate over the period that extended to the next meeting of the Committee.8 In response to House Concurrent Resolution 133 in 1975  the Federal Reserve began to report annual target growth ranges  2 to 3 percentage points wide  for M1  M2  a still broader aggregate M3  and bank credit in semiannual testimony before the Congress. In an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977  the Congress formalized the Federal Reserve’s reporting of monetary targets by directing the Board to "maintain long run growth of monetary and credit aggregates … so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment  stable prices  and moderate long-term interest rates."9 In practice  however  the adoption of targets for money and credit growth was evidently not effective in constraining policy or in reducing inflation  in part because the target was not routinely achieved.10 The closest the Federal Reserve came to a "monetarist experiment" began in October 1979  when the FOMC under Chairman Paul Volcker adopted an operating procedure based on the management of non-borrowed reserves.11 The intent was to focus policy on controlling the growth of M1 and M2 and thereby to reduce inflation  which had been running at double-digit rates. As you know  the disinflation 5 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1960). 6 In 1971  M1 was currency and demand deposits at commercial banks. M2 was M1 plus commercial bank savings and small time deposits  and M3 was M2 plus deposits at mutual savings banks  savings and loans  and credit unions; data from the latter type of institution were available only monthly. M4 was M2 plus large time deposits  and M5 was M3 plus large time deposits. Changes in definitions make it difficult to track the historical development of the various monetary aggregates. Approximately  the 2006 definition of M1 is equivalent to this older definition  the 2006 definition of M2 is equivalent to the older definition of M3  and the definition of M3 at its date of last publication was equivalent to the older definition of M5. M4 and M5 were dropped in a 1980 redefinition of the monetary aggregates. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1976)  pp. 10-11 and Anderson and Kavajecz (1994). 7 For instance  in late 1959 and early 1960  money growth declined as other economic indicators rose. The minutes of the December 1959 FOMC meeting report Chairman Martin as saying  "I am unable to make heads or tails of the money supply " but those of the February 1960 meeting record his comment that "the System ought to be looking at the growth of the money supply." For further discussion  see Bremner (2004)  pp. 141-142. 8 M2 now includes currency and demand deposits (the components of M1) plus time deposits  savings deposits  and non- institutional money market funds. 9 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1998)  1-017 10 Monetarists criticized the use of multiple targets  rather than a single objective. Another object of criticism was "base drift " a set of practices that had the effect of re-setting the base from which money growth targets were calculated when the growth of one or more monetary aggregates exceeded the upper end of the Federal Reserve’s target range. 11 Whether the Federal Reserve’s policies under Chairman Volcker were "truly" monetarist was a much-debated question at the time. 2 BIS Review 110/2006 effort was successful and ushered in the low-inflation regime that the United States has enjoyed since. However  the Federal Reserve discontinued the procedure based on non-borrowed reserves in 1982. It would be fair to say that monetary and credit aggregates have not played a central role in the formulation of U.S. monetary policy since that time  although policymakers continue to use monetary data as a source of information about the state of the economy. Why have monetary aggregates not been more influential in U.S. monetary policymaking  despite the strong theoretical presumption that money growth should be linked to growth in nominal aggregates and to inflation? In practice  the difficulty has been that  in the United States  deregulation  financial innovation  and other factors have led to recurrent instability in the relationships between various monetary aggregates and other nominal variables. For example  in the mid-1970s  just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets  econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down  predicting faster money growth than was actually observed. This breakdown - dubbed "the case of the missing money" by Princeton economist Stephen Goldfeld (1976) - significantly complicated the selection of appropriate targets for money growth. Similar problems arose in the early 1980s - the period of the Volcker experiment - when the introduction of new types of bank accounts again made M1 money demand difficult to predict.12 Attempts to find stable relationships between M1 growth and growth in other nominal quantities were unsuccessful  and formal growth rate targets for M1 were discontinued in 1987. Problems with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 in the 1970s and 1980s led to increased interest at the Federal Reserve in the 1980s in broader aggregates such as M2. Econometric methods were also refined to improve estimation and to accommodate more-complex dynamics in money demand equations. For example  at a 1988 conference at the Federal Reserve Board  George Moore  Richard Porter  and David Small presented a new set of M2 money demand models based on an "error- correction" specification  which allowed for transitory deviations from stable long-run relationships (Moore  Porter  and Small  1990). One of these models  known as the "conference aggregate" model  remains in use at the Board today. About the same time  Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model  based on M2  which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends. The P* model received considerable attention both within and outside the System; indeed  a description of the model was featured in a front-page article in the New York Times.13 Unfortunately  over the years the stability of the economic relationships based on the M2 monetary aggregate has also come into question. One such episode occurred in the early 1990s  when M2 grew much more slowly than the models predicted. Indeed  the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model  if not subjected to judgmental adjustments  would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992. Experiences like this one led the FOMC to discontinue setting target ranges for M2 and other aggregates after the statutory requirement for reporting such ranges lapsed in 2000. As I have already suggested  the rapid pace of financial innovation in the United States has been an important reason for the instability of the relationships between monetary aggregates and other macroeconomic variables.14 In response to regulatory changes and technological progress  U.S. banks have created new kinds of accounts and added features to existing accounts. More broadly  payments technologies and practices have changed substantially over the past few decades  and innovations (such as Internet banking) continue. As a result  patterns of usage of different types of transactions accounts have at times shifted rapidly and unpredictably. Various special factors have also contributed to the observed instability. For example  between one- half and two-thirds of U.S. currency is held abroad. As a consequence  cross-border currency flows  which can be estimated only imprecisely  may lead to sharp changes in currency outstanding and in the monetary base that are largely unrelated to domestic conditions.15 16 12 The new accounts included negotiable-order-of-withdrawal (NOW) accounts and money market deposit accounts. 13 Hallman  Porter  and Small (1991) and Kilborn (1989). 14 Another possible explanation for this instability is the Goodhart-Lucas law  which says that any empirical relationship that is exploited for policy purposes will tend to break down. This law probably has less applicability in the United States than in some other countries  as the Federal Reserve has not systematically exploited the relationships of money to output or inflation  except perhaps to a degree in 1979-82. 15 For a recent summary  see U.S. Department of the Treasury (2006). BIS Review 110/2006 3 The Board staff continues to devote considerable effort to modeling and forecasting velocity and money demand. The standard model of money demand  which relates money held to measures of income and opportunity cost  has been extended to include alternative measures of money and its determinants  to accommodate special factors and structural breaks  and to allow for complex dynamic behavior of the money stock.17 Forecasts of money growth are based on expert judgment with input from various estimated models and with knowledge of special factors that are expected to be relevant. Unfortunately  forecast errors for money growth are often significant  and the empirical relationship between money growth and variables such as inflation and nominal output growth has continued to be unstable at times.18 Despite these difficulties  the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor and analyze the behavior of money. Although a heavy reliance on monetary aggregates as a guide to policy would seem to be unwise in the U.S. context  money growth may still contain important information about future economic developments. Attention to money growth is thus sensible as part of the eclectic modeling and forecasting framework used by the U.S. central bank. References Anderson  Richard G. and Kenneth A. Kavajecz (1994).

A wave of mortgage refinancing and the resulting prepayments can thus have significant effects on M2 growth that are only weakly related to overall economic activity. See O’Brien (2005) for more discussion. 17 See Judson and Carpenter (2006) for a summary. A special factor that helps to explain some episodes of variable money demand is stock market volatility (Carpenter and Lange  2003). 18 A recent example of instability occurred in the fourth quarter of 2003  when M2 shrank at the most rapid rate since the beginning of modern data collection in 1959 without any evident effects on prices or nominal spending. Subsequent analysis has explained part of the decline in M2 (the transfer of liquid funds into a recovering stock market was one possible cause)  and data revisions have eliminated an additional portion of the decline  but much of the drop remains unexplained even well after the fact. 4 BIS Review 110/2006 Goldfeld  Stephen M.
