TITLE=Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy since the onset of the crisis

Ben S Bernanke: Monetary policy since the onset of the crisis 
Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium, Jackson Hole, 
Wyoming, 31 August 2012. 
 When we convened in Jackson Hole in August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee’s 
(FOMC) target for the federal funds rate was 5-1/4 percent. Sixteen months later, with the 
financial crisis in full swing, the FOMC had lowered the target for the federal funds rate to 
nearly  zero,  thereby  entering  the  unfamiliar  territory  of  having  to  conduct  monetary  policy 
with the policy interest rate at its effective lower bound. The unusual severity of the recession 
and ongoing strains in financial markets made the challenges facing monetary policymakers 
all the greater.  
Today I will review the evolution of U.S. monetary policy since late 2007. My focus will be the 
Federal  Reserve’s  experience  with  nontraditional  policy  tools,  notably  those  based  on  the 
management of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and on its public communications. I’ll 
discuss what we have learned about the efficacy and drawbacks of these less familiar forms 
of  monetary  policy,  and  I’ll  talk  about  the  implications  for  the  Federal  Reserve’s  ongoing 
efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.  
Monetary policy in 2007 and 2008 
When  significant  financial  stresses  first  emerged,  in  August  2007,  the  FOMC  responded 
quickly, first through liquidity actions – cutting the discount rate and extending term loans to 
banks – and then, in September, by lowering the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis 
points.1 As further indications of economic weakness appeared over subsequent months, the 
Committee  reduced  its  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  by  a  cumulative  325  basis  points, 
leaving the target at 2 percent by the spring of 2008.  
The Committee held rates constant over the summer as it monitored economic and financial 
conditions.  When  the  crisis  intensified  markedly  in  the  fall,  the  Committee  responded  by 
cutting the target for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in October, with half of this 
easing coming as part of an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut by six major central 
banks.  Then,  in  December  2008,  as  evidence  of  a  dramatic  slowdown  mounted,  the 
Committee reduced its target to a range of 0 to 25 basis points, effectively its lower bound. 
That target range remains in place today.  
Despite the easing of monetary policy, dysfunction in credit markets continued to worsen. As 
you know, in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary 
steps to provide liquidity and support credit market functioning, including the establishment of 
a  number  of  emergency  lending  facilities  and  the  creation  or  extension  of  currency  swap 
agreements  with  14  central  banks  around  the  world.2  In  its  role  as  banking  regulator,  the 
Federal Reserve also led stress tests of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, setting the 
stage for the companies to raise capital. These actions – along with a host of interventions by 
other policymakers in the United States and throughout the world – helped stabilize global 
financial markets, which in turn served to check the deterioration in the real economy and the 
emergence of deflationary pressures.

Unfortunately, although it is likely that even worse outcomes had been averted, the damage 
to the economy was severe. The unemployment rate in the United States rose from about 
6 percent in September 2008 to nearly 9 percent by April 2009 – it would peak at 10 percent 
in October – while inflation declined sharply. As the crisis crested, and with the federal funds 
rate  at  its  effective  lower  bound,  the  FOMC  turned  to  nontraditional  policy  approaches  to 
support the recovery.  
As the Committee embarked on this path, we were guided by some general principles and 
some  insightful  academic  work  but  –  with  the  important  exception  of  the  Japanese 
case – limited historical  experience. As a result, central bankers in the United States, and 
those  in  other  advanced  economies  facing  similar  problems,  have  been  in  the  process  of 
learning  by  doing.  I  will  discuss  some  of  what  we  have  learned,  beginning  with  our 
experience  conducting  policy  using  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance  sheet,  then  turn  to  our 
use of communications tools.  
Balance sheet tools 
In using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as a tool for achieving its mandated objectives 
of  maximum  employment  and  price  stability,  the  FOMC  has  focused  on  the  acquisition  of 
longer-term securities – specifically, Treasury and agency securities, which are the principal 
types of securities that the Federal Reserve is permitted to buy under the Federal Reserve 
Act.3 One mechanism through which such purchases are believed to affect the economy is 
the  so-called  portfolio  balance  channel,  which  is  based  on  the  ideas  of  a  number  of 
well-known  monetary  economists, 
including  James  Tobin,  Milton  Friedman,  Franco 
Modigliani, Karl Brunner, and Allan Meltzer. The key premise underlying this channel is that, 
for  a  variety  of  reasons,  different  classes  of  financial  assets  are  not  perfect  substitutes  in 
investors’ portfolios.4 For example, some institutional investors face regulatory restrictions on 
the types of securities they can hold, retail investors may be reluctant to hold certain types of 
assets  because  of  high  transactions  or  information  costs,  and  some  assets  have  risk 
characteristics that are difficult or costly to hedge.  
Imperfect  substitutability  of  assets  implies  that  changes  in  the  supplies  of  various  assets 
available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of those assets. Thus, Federal 
Reserve  purchases  of  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBS),  for  example,  should  raise  the 
prices  and  lower  the  yields  of  those  securities;  moreover,  as  investors  rebalance  their 
portfolios by replacing the MBS sold to the Federal Reserve with other assets, the prices of 
the assets they buy should rise and their yields decline as well. Declining yields and rising 
asset  prices  ease  overall  financial  conditions  and  stimulate  economic  activity  through 
channels  similar  to  those  for  conventional  monetary  policy.  Following  this  logic,  Tobin 
suggested that purchases of longer-term securities by the Federal Reserve during the Great 
Depression  could  have  helped  the  U.S.  economy  recover  despite  the  fact  that  short-term 
                                                
3  Agency  securities  are  securities  issued  by  the government-sponsored  enterprises  (GSEs)  and include  both 
mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by GSEs and GSE debt. Since August 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac  have  been  in  government  conservatorship  with  capital  support  provided  by  the  U.S.  Treasury.  The 
Federal  Reserve’s  net  acquisitions  of  securities  are  financed  by  the  creation  of  commercial  bank  reserves, 
which in turn are held in accounts at the Federal Reserve. (*The text of this footnote has been revised since its 
original release.)

Schwartz  (1982).  Nelson  (2011)  discusses  the  relevance  of  Friedman’s  views  for  recent  Federal 
Reserve  policy.  For  modern  treatments  of  the  portfolio balance  channel  in  a  macroeconomic  context, 
see Andrés, López-Salido, and Nelson (2004). The portfolio balance channel would be inoperative under 
various  strong  assumptions  that  I  view  as  empirically  implausible,  such  as  complete  and  frictionless 
financial  markets  and  full  internalization  by  private  investors  of  the  government’s  balance  sheet 
(Ricardian equivalence).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
rates were close to zero, and Friedman argued for large-scale purchases of long-term bonds 
by the Bank of Japan to help overcome Japan’s deflationary trap.5  
Large-scale  asset  purchases  can  influence  financial  conditions  and  the  broader  economy 
through other channels as well. For instance, they can signal that the central bank intends to 
pursue  a  persistently  more  accommodative  policy  stance  than  previously  thought,  thereby 
lowering  investors’  expectations  for  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  and  putting 
additional  downward  pressure  on  long-term  interest  rates,  particularly  in  real  terms.  Such 
signaling  can  also  increase  household  and  business  confidence  by  helping  to  diminish 
concerns about “tail” risks such as deflation. During stressful periods, asset purchases may 
also improve the functioning of financial markets, thereby easing credit conditions in some 
sectors.  
With the space for further cuts in the target for the federal funds rate increasingly limited, in 
late 2008 the Federal Reserve initiated a series of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). In 
November,  the  FOMC  announced  a  program  to purchase  a total  of  $600  billion  in  agency 
MBS  and  agency  debt.6  In  March  2009,  the  FOMC  expanded  this  purchase  program 
substantially,  announcing  that  it  would  purchase  up  to  $1.25  trillion  of  agency  MBS,  up  to 
$200  billion  of  agency  debt,  and  up  to  $300  billion  of  longer-term  Treasury  debt.7  These 
purchases were completed, with minor adjustments, in early 2010.8 In November 2010, the 
FOMC  announced  that  it  would  further  expand  the  Federal  Reserve’s  security  holdings  by 
purchasing an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over a period ending 
in mid-2011.9  
About a year ago, the FOMC introduced a variation on its earlier purchase programs, known 
as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal Reserve would purchase 
$400 billion of long-term Treasury securities and sell an equivalent amount of shorter-term 
Treasury  securities  over  the  period  ending  in  June  2012.10 The  FOMC  subsequently 
extended the MEP through the end of this year.11 By reducing the average maturity of the 
securities  held  by  the  public,  the  MEP  puts  additional  downward  pressure  on  longer-term 
interest rates and further eases overall financial conditions.  
How  effective  are  balance  sheet  policies?  After  nearly  four  years  of  experience  with 
large-scale  asset  purchases,  a  substantial  body  of  empirical  work  on  their  effects  has 
emerged.  Generally,  this  research  finds  that  the  Federal  Reserve’s  large-scale  purchases 
have significantly lowered long-term Treasury yields. For example, studies have found that 
the $1.7 trillion in purchases of Treasury and agency securities under the first LSAP program 
reduced the yield on 10-year Treasury securities by between 40 and 110 basis points. The 
$600 billion in Treasury purchases under the second LSAP program has been credited with 
lowering 10-year yields by an additional 15 to 45 basis points.12 Three studies considering 
                                                
5  See Tobin (1965) and Friedman (2000). 
6  See Board of Governors (2008). 
7  See Board of Governors (2009). 
8  Several months later, to avoid an implicit tightening in policy associated with the runoff of maturing securities, the 
Federal Reserve also began reinvesting the principal payments received on agency MBS and debt into Treasury 
securities and continued to roll over maturing longer-term Treasury debt. See Board of Governors (2010a). 
9  See Board of Governors (2010b). 
10  At the same time, the Committee announced that it would reinvest principal payments from agency debt and 
agency MBS into agency MBS. See Board of Governors (2011a).

and others (2011), Hamilton and Wu (2012), Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011), Meaning and Zhu 
(2011), Swanson (2011), D’Amico and others (forthcoming), and Wright (2012).

the cumulative influence of all the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases, including those made 
under the MEP, found total effects between 80 and 120 basis points on the 10-year Treasury 
yield.13 These effects are economically meaningful.  
Importantly,  the  effects  of  LSAPs  do  not  appear  to  be  confined  to  longer-term  Treasury 
yields.  Notably,  LSAPs  have  been  found  to  be  associated  with  significant  declines  in  the 
yields  on  both  corporate  bonds  and  MBS.14  The  first  purchase  program,  in  particular,  has 
been linked to substantial reductions in MBS yields and retail mortgage rates. LSAPs also 
appear  to  have  boosted  stock  prices,  presumably  both  by  lowering  discount  rates  and  by 
improving the economic outlook; it is probably not a coincidence that the sustained recovery 
in  U.S.  equity  prices  began  in  March  2009,  shortly  after  the  FOMC’s  decision  to  greatly 
expand securities purchases. This effect is potentially important because stock values affect 
both consumption and investment decisions.  
While there is substantial evidence that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases have lowered 
longer-term yields and eased broader financial conditions, obtaining precise estimates of the 
effects  of  these  operations  on  the  broader  economy  is  inherently  difficult,  as  the 
counterfactual  –  how  the  economy  would  have  performed  in  the  absence  of  the  Federal 
Reserve’s  actions  –  cannot  be  directly  observed.  If  we  are  willing  to  take  as  a  working 
assumption that the effects of easier financial conditions on the economy are similar to those 
observed historically, then econometric models can be used to estimate the effects of LSAPs 
on the economy. Model simulations conducted at the Federal Reserve generally find that the 
securities purchase programs have provided significant help for the economy. For example, 
a study using the Board’s FRB/US model of the economy found that, as of 2012, the first two 
rounds  of  LSAPs  may  have  raised  the  level  of  output  by  almost  3  percent  and  increased 
private  payroll  employment  by  more  than  2  million  jobs,  relative  to  what  otherwise  would 
have occurred.15 The Bank of England has used LSAPs in a manner similar to that of the 
Federal  Reserve,  so  it  is  of  interest  that  researchers  have  found  the  financial  and 
macroeconomic  effects  of  the  British  programs  to  be  qualitatively  similar  to  those  in  the 
United States.16  
                                                
13  See Pandl (2012), Meyer and Bomfim (2012), and Li and Wei (2012). One important feature of these analyses 
is that they are not just based on event studies. For example, the Li and Wei study employs a no-arbitrage 
model of the term structure of interest rates and time-series data from 1994 to 2007 to estimate the effects on 
term premiums of changes in the amount of longer-term Treasury debt and agency MBS held by the public. 
Using this model, Li and Wei are able to infer the effects of the two LSAP programs and the MEP, controlling 
for  changes  in  the  expected  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  and  its  implications  for  long-term  interest  rates. 
Their  analysis  suggests  that  the  Federal  Reserve’s  asset purchases  are  an  important  factor  underlying  the 
current very low level of the term premium in longer-term rates. 
14  On corporate bonds, see Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jørgensen (2011) and Wright (2012); Fuster and Willen 
(2010), Hancock and Passmore (2011), and Wright (2012) report results on mortgage yields. Early skeptics of 
balance sheet policies worried that any effects on Treasury yields would not be transmitted to other interest 
rates  and  asset  prices.  The  evidence  reported  in  these  papers  refutes  this  concern,  as  does  the  fact  that 
spreads  of investment-grade  corporate  bond  yields  and  mortgage  rates  over  comparable-maturity  Treasury 
yields  were  not  elevated  from  late  2009  through  mid-2011;  those  spreads  have  since  risen  somewhat, 
reflecting in part concerns about the European situation and the pace of the U.S. economic recovery. 
15  See Chung and others (2012) for details of assumptions and simulation results. Focusing only on the second 
LSAP program, Fuhrer and Olivei (2011) find comparable effects, attributing to that program a bit less than a 
1 percent  increase  in  output  and  700,000  new  jobs.  Using  different  methodologies,  Kiley  (2012)  finds 
significantly smaller effects and Baumeister and Benati (2010) find larger effects. 
16  Joyce, Tong, and Woods (2011) summarize a range of estimates of the macroeconomic effects of the Bank of 
England’s quantitative easing program, which, relative to size of the U.K. economy, is roughly equivalent in 
scale  to  the  Federal  Reserve’s  two  LSAP  programs.  Those  estimates  suggest  a  peak  effect  of  1-1/2  to 
2 percent  for  real  output  and  between  3/4  and  1-1/2  percent  for  inflation  in  the  United  Kingdom.  See  also 
Baumeister and Benati (2010) and Christensen and Rudebusch (2012).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
To be sure, these estimates of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs should be treated with 
caution.  It  is  likely  that  the  crisis  and  the  recession  have  attenuated  some  of  the  normal 
transmission  channels  of  monetary  policy  relative  to  what  is  assumed  in  the  models;  for 
example,  restrictive  mortgage  underwriting  standards  have  reduced  the  effects  of  lower 
mortgage  rates.  Further,  the  estimated  macroeconomic  effects  depend  on  uncertain 
estimates  of  the  persistence  of  the  effects  of  LSAPs  on  financial  conditions.17  Overall, 
however,  a  balanced  reading  of  the  evidence  supports  the  conclusion  that  central  bank 
securities  purchases  have  provided  meaningful  support  to  the  economic  recovery  while 
mitigating deflationary risks.  
Now I will turn to our use of communications tools.  
Communication tools 
Clear  communication  is  always  important  in  central  banking,  but  it  can  be  especially 
important  when  economic  conditions  call  for  further  policy  stimulus  but  the  policy  rate  is 
already at its effective lower bound. In particular, forward guidance that lowers private-sector 
expectations  regarding  future  short-term  rates  should  cause  longer-term  interest  rates  to 
decline, leading to more accommodative financial conditions.18  
The  Federal  Reserve  has  made  considerable  use  of  forward  guidance  as  a  policy  tool. 19 
From  March  2009  through  June  2011,  the  FOMC’s  postmeeting  statement  noted  that 
economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate 
for  an  extended  period.”20  At  the  August  2011 meeting,  the  Committee  made  its  guidance 
more precise by stating that economic conditions would likely warrant that the federal funds 
rate remain exceptionally low “at least through mid-2013.”21 At the beginning of this year, the 
FOMC extended the anticipated period of exceptionally low rates further, to “at least through 
late  2014,” guidance  that  has  been reaffirmed  at  subsequent meetings.22  As  the  language 
indicates, this guidance is not an unconditional promise; rather, it is a statement about the 
FOMC’s collective judgment regarding the path of policy that is likely to prove appropriate, 
given the Committee’s objectives and its outlook for the economy.  
The  views  of  Committee  members  regarding  the  likely  timing  of  policy  firming  represent  a 
balance  of  many  factors,  but  the  current  forward  guidance  is  broadly  consistent  with 
prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including simple policy rules and 
optimal  control  methods.23  Some  of  the  policy  rules  informing  the  forward  guidance  relate 
                                                
17  For example, while the macroeconomic effects reported by Chung and others (2012) are consistent with the 
persistence of financial effects as estimated by Li and Wei (2012), Wright (2012) finds much less persistence 
using a different methodology. Kiley (2012) also provides arguments and evidence for why LSAPs may have 
been less stimulative than found in Chung and others (2012) and Fuhrer and Olivei (2011). 
18  See  Eggertsson  and  Woodford  (2003)  and  Levin  and  others  (2010)  for  discussions  of  the  role  of 
communication at the zero lower bound. 
19  As with asset purchases, the Federal Reserve has not been alone in using forward policy guidance. The Bank 
of Canada, for example, announced in April 2009 its intention to hold the overnight policy at 25 basis points 
through the second quarter of 2010; this conditional guidance was subject to the bank’s assessment of future 
inflation  trends.  The  Bank  of  Japan  has  long  provided  forward  guidance  linking  policy  to  economic 
developments. In March 2001, for example, the Bank of Japan committed to maintain its policy rate at zero 
until  Japanese  consumer  prices  stabilized  or  exhibited  a  year-on-year  increase.  The  Riksbank  and  the 
Reserve Bank of New Zealand in recent years have made statements about the future course of the policy 
rate similar to those provided by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada.

policy  interest  rates  to  familiar  determinants,  such  as  inflation  and  the  output  gap.  But  a 
number  of considerations  also  argue for  planning to keep  rates  low for a  longer  time than 
implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods. These considerations include 
the  need  to  take  out  insurance  against  the  realization  of  downside  risks,  which  are 
particularly  difficult  to  manage  when  rates  are  close  to  their  effective  lower  bound;  the 
possibility  that,  because  of  various  unusual  headwinds  slowing  the  recovery,  the  economy 
needs more policy support than usual at this stage of the cycle; and the need to compensate 
for limits to policy accommodation resulting from the lower bound on rates.24  
Has the forward guidance been effective? It is certainly true that, over time, both investors 
and  private  forecasters  have  pushed  out  considerably  the  date  at  which  they  expect  the 
federal funds rate to begin to rise; moreover, current policy expectations appear to align well 
with the FOMC’s forward guidance. To be sure, the changes over time in when the private 
sector  expects  the  federal  funds  rate  to  begin  firming  resulted  in  part  from  the  same 
deterioration  of  the  economic  outlook  that  led  the  FOMC  to  introduce  and  then  extend  its 
forward guidance. But the private sector’s revised outlook for the policy rate also appears to 
reflect  a  growing  appreciation  of  how  forceful  the  FOMC  intends  to  be  in  supporting  a 
sustainable  recovery.  For  example,  since  2009,  forecasters  participating  in  the  Blue  Chip 
survey have repeatedly marked down their projections of the unemployment rate they expect 
to prevail at the time that the FOMC begins to lift the target for the federal funds rate away 
from  zero.  Thus,  the  Committee’s  forward  guidance  may  have  conveyed  a  greater 
willingness  to  maintain  accommodation  than  private  forecasters  had  previously  believed.25 
The behavior of financial market prices in periods around changes in the forward guidance is 
also consistent with the view that the guidance has affected policy expectations.26  
Making policy with nontraditional tools: a cost-benefit framework 
Making monetary policy with nontraditional tools is challenging. In particular, our experience 
with these tools remains limited. In this context, the FOMC carefully compares the expected 
benefits and costs of proposed policy actions.  
The  potential  benefit  of  policy  action,  of  course,  is  the  possibility  of  better  economic 
outcomes  –  outcomes  more  consistent  with  the  FOMC’s  dual  mandate.  In  light  of  the 
evidence I discussed, it appears reasonable to conclude that nontraditional policy tools have 
been and can continue to be effective in providing financial accommodation, though we are 
less certain about the magnitude and persistence of these effects than we are about those of 
more-traditional policies.  
                                                
24  On responding to unusual headwinds (technically, a situation in which a lower real interest rate is required to 
achieve full employment), see Williams (2009). On risk management near the zero lower bound, see Orphanides 
and Wieland  (2000).  On  compensating  for  limits  to  policy  accommodation  attributable  to  the  lower  bound  on 
rates, see Reifschneider and Williams (2000). Another argument for sustaining low rates follows because optimal 
policies may involve a slow, or “inertial,” adjustment of rates; see, for example, Woodford (2003). 
25  In October 2009, private forecasters in the Blue Chip survey projected that the unemployment rate would be 
near 10 percent and overall inflation as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) would be 2 percent at 
the time that short-term interest rates (three-month Treasury bill rates) rose above 50 basis points. By March 
2011,  forecasters  had  lowered  the  projected  unemployment  rate  at  the  policy  liftoff  date  to  about 
8-1/2 percent, again accompanied by inflation near 2 percent. And by March 2012, forecasters projected that 
the unemployment rate would have fallen below 7-1/2 percent, and that CPI inflation would be moving up to 
close to 2-1/2 percent, before short-term interest rates would rise appreciably above the current target range. 
26  For example, Board staff members have performed event studies of the movement in Eurodollar futures prices 
and other financial variables immediately following the release of the August 2011 and January 2012 FOMC 
statements. In both cases, the provision of specific guidance about the likely date of liftoff was associated with 
a noticeable flattening of the expected path of the federal funds rate. For a formal analysis of the effectiveness 
of the FOMC’s forward guidance, see Swanson and Williams (2012).

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
The  possible  benefits  of  an  action,  however,  must  be  considered  alongside  its  potential 
costs. I will focus now on the potential costs of LSAPs.  
One possible cost of conducting additional LSAPs is that these operations could impair the 
functioning of securities markets. As I noted, the Federal Reserve is limited by law mainly to 
the purchase of Treasury and agency securities; the supply of those securities is large but 
finite, and not all of the supply is actively traded. Conceivably, if the Federal Reserve became 
too  dominant  a  buyer  in  certain  segments  of  these  markets,  trading  among private  agents 
could dry up, degrading liquidity and price discovery. As the global financial system depends 
on  deep  and  liquid  markets  for  U.S.  Treasury  securities,  significant  impairment  of  those 
markets  would  be  costly,  and,  in  particular,  could  impede  the  transmission  of  monetary 
policy. For example, market disruptions could lead to higher liquidity premiums on Treasury 
securities, which would run counter to the policy goal of reducing Treasury yields. However, 
although market capacity could ultimately become an issue, to this point we have seen few if 
any  problems  in  the  markets  for  Treasury  or  agency  securities,  private-sector  holdings  of 
securities remain large, and trading among private market participants remains robust.  
A  second  potential  cost  of  additional  securities  purchases  is  that  substantial  further 
expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed’s ability to exit 
smoothly from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time. Even if unjustified, such a 
reduction  in  confidence  might  increase  the  risk  of  a  costly  unanchoring  of  inflation 
expectations, leading in turn to financial and economic instability. It is noteworthy, however, 
that  the  expansion  of  the  balance  sheet  to  date  has  not  materially  affected  inflation 
expectations, likely in part because of the great emphasis the Federal Reserve has placed 
on developing tools to ensure that we can normalize monetary policy when appropriate, even 
if  our  securities  holdings  remain  large.  In  particular,  the  FOMC  will  be  able  to  put  upward 
pressure on short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays banks for reserves 
they  hold  at  the  Fed.  Upward  pressure  on  rates  can  also  be  achieved  by  using 
reserve-draining  tools  or  by  selling  securities  from  the  Federal  Reserve’s  portfolio,  thus 
reversing the effects achieved by LSAPs. The FOMC has spent considerable effort planning 
and testing our exit strategy and will act decisively to execute it at the appropriate time.  
A third cost to be weighed is that of risks to financial stability. For example, some observers 
have raised concerns that, by driving longer-term yields lower, nontraditional policies could 
induce  an  imprudent  reach  for  yield  by  some  investors  and  thereby  threaten  financial 
stability.  Of  course,  one  objective  of  both  traditional  and  nontraditional  policy  during 
recoveries is to promote a return to productive risk-taking; as always, the goal is to strike the 
appropriate  balance.  Moreover,  a  stronger  recovery  is  itself  clearly  helpful  for  financial 
stability. In assessing this risk, it is important to note that the Federal Reserve, both on its 
own and in collaboration with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has 
substantially  expanded  its  monitoring  of  the  financial  system  and  modified  its  supervisory 
approach  to  take  a  more  systemic  perspective.  We  have  seen  little  evidence  thus  far  of 
unsafe buildups of risk or leverage, but we will continue both our careful oversight and the 
implementation of financial regulatory reforms aimed at reducing systemic risk.  
A fourth potential cost of balance sheet policies is the possibility that the Federal Reserve 
could  incur  financial  losses  should  interest  rates  rise  to  an  unexpected  extent.  Extensive 
analyses suggest that, from a purely fiscal perspective, the odds are strong that the Fed’s 
asset purchases will make money for the taxpayers, reducing the federal deficit and debt.27 
And, of course, to the extent that monetary policy helps strengthen the economy and raise 
incomes, the benefits for the U.S. fiscal position would be substantial. In any case, this purely 
fiscal perspective is too narrow: Because Americans are workers and consumers as well as 
                                                
27  Remittances  to  the  Treasury  from  the  Federal  Reserve  have  totaled about  $200  billion over  the  past  three 
years, well above historical averages.

taxpayers,  monetary  policy  can  achieve  the  most  for  the  country  by  focusing  generally  on 
improving  economic  performance  rather  than  narrowly  on  possible  gains  or  losses  on  the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  
In sum, both the benefits and costs of nontraditional monetary policies are uncertain; in all 
likelihood,  they  will  also  vary  over  time,  depending  on  factors  such  as  the  state  of  the 
economy  and  financial  markets  and  the  extent  of  prior  Federal  Reserve  asset  purchases. 
Moreover, nontraditional policies have potential costs that may be less relevant for traditional 
policies. For these reasons, the hurdle for using nontraditional policies should be higher than 
for traditional policies. At the same time, the costs of nontraditional policies, when considered 
carefully, appear manageable, implying that we should not rule out the further use of such 
policies if economic conditions warrant.  
Economic prospects 
The  accommodative  monetary  policies  I  have  reviewed  today,  both  traditional  and 
nontraditional,  have  provided  important  support  to  the  economic  recovery  while  helping  to 
maintain price stability. As of July, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.3 percent from its 
cyclical peak of 10 percent and payrolls had risen by 4 million jobs from their low point. And 
despite periodic concerns about deflation risks, on the one hand, and repeated warnings that 
excessive policy accommodation would ignite inflation, on the other hand, inflation (except 
for temporary deviations caused primarily by swings in commodity prices) has remained near 
the  Committee’s  2  percent  objective  and  inflation  expectations  have  remained  stable.  Key 
sectors  such  as  manufacturing,  housing,  and  international  trade  have  strengthened,  firms’ 
investment in equipment and software has rebounded, and conditions in financial and credit 
markets have improved.  
Notwithstanding  these  positive  signs,  the  economic  situation  is  obviously  far  from 
satisfactory.  The  unemployment  rate  remains  more  than  2  percentage  points  above  what 
most FOMC participants see as its longer-run normal value, and other indicators – such as 
the labor force participation rate and the number of people working part time for economic 
reasons – confirm that labor force utilization remains at very low levels. Further, the rate of 
improvement in the labor market has been painfully slow. I have noted on other occasions 
that  the  declines  in  unemployment  we  have  seen  would  likely  continue  only  if  economic 
growth picked up to a rate above its longer-term trend.28 In fact, growth in recent quarters 
has  been  tepid,  and  so,  not  surprisingly,  we  have  seen  no  net  improvement  in  the 
unemployment rate since January. Unless the economy begins to grow more quickly than it 
has  recently,  the  unemployment  rate  is  likely  to  remain  far  above  levels  consistent  with 
maximum employment for some time.  
In light of the policy actions the FOMC has taken to date, as well as the economy’s natural 
recovery  mechanisms,  we  might  have  hoped  for  greater  progress  by  now  in  returning  to 
maximum employment. Some have taken the lack of progress as evidence that the financial 
crisis  caused  structural  damage 
levels  of 
unemployment  impervious  to  additional  monetary  accommodation.  The  literature  on  this 
issue  is  extensive,  and  I  cannot  fully  review  it  today.29  However,  following  every  previous 
U.S.  recession  since  World  War  II,  the  unemployment  rate  has  returned  close  to  its 
pre-recession  level,  and,  although  the  recent  recession  was  unusually  deep,  I  see  little 
evidence of substantial structural change in recent years.  
Rather than attributing the slow recovery to longer-term structural factors, I see growth being 
held back currently by a number of headwinds. First, although the housing sector has shown 
the  economy,  rendering

signs of improvement, housing activity remains at low levels and is contributing much less to 
the recovery than would normally be expected at this stage of the cycle.  
Second, fiscal policy, at both the federal and state and local levels, has become an important 
headwind for the pace of economic growth. Notwithstanding some recent improvement in tax 
revenues, state and local governments still face tight budget situations and continue to cut 
real  spending  and  employment.  Real  purchases  are  also  declining  at  the  federal  level. 
Uncertainties about fiscal policy, notably about the resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff and 
the lifting of the debt ceiling, are probably also restraining activity, although the magnitudes 
of these effects are hard to judge.30 It is critical that fiscal policymakers put in place a credible 
plan that sets the federal budget on a sustainable trajectory in the medium and longer runs. 
However,  policymakers should  take  care to  avoid  a  sharp  near-term fiscal  contraction  that 
could endanger the recovery.  
Third, stresses in credit and financial markets continue to restrain the economy. Earlier in the 
recovery,  limited  credit  availability  was  an  important  factor  holding  back  growth,  and  tight 
borrowing conditions for some potential homebuyers and small businesses remain a problem 
today. More recently, however, a major source of financial strains has been uncertainty about 
developments in Europe. These strains are most problematic for the Europeans, of course, 
but through global trade and financial linkages, the effects of the European situation on the 
U.S.  economy  are  significant  as  well.  Some  recent  policy  proposals  in  Europe  have  been 
quite  constructive,  in  my  view,  and  I  urge  our  European  colleagues  to  press  ahead  with 
policy initiatives to resolve the crisis.  
Conclusion 
Early in my tenure as a member of the Board of Governors, I gave a speech that considered 
options for monetary policy  when the short-term policy interest rate is close to its effective 
lower bound.31 I was reacting to common assertions at the time that monetary policymakers 
would be “out of ammunition” as the federal funds rate came closer to zero. I argued that, to 
the contrary, policy could still be effective near the lower bound. Now, with several years of 
experience  with  nontraditional  policies  both  in  the  United  States  and  in  other  advanced 
economies,  we  know  more  about  how  such  policies  work.  It  seems  clear,  based  on  this 
experience,  that  such  policies  can  be  effective,  and  that,  in  their  absence,  the  2007–09 
recession would have been deeper and the current recovery would have been slower than 
has actually occurred.  
As  I  have  discussed  today,  it  is  also  true  that  nontraditional  policies  are  relatively  more 
difficult to apply, at least given the present state of our knowledge. Estimates of the effects of 
nontraditional  policies  on  economic  activity  and  inflation  are  uncertain,  and  the  use  of 
nontraditional policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with more-standard 
policies.  Consequently,  the  bar  for  the  use  of  nontraditional  policies  is  higher  than  for 
traditional  policies.  In  addition,  in  the  present  context,  nontraditional  policies  share  the 
limitations of monetary policy more generally: Monetary policy cannot achieve by itself what a 
broader and more balanced set of economic policies might achieve; in particular, it cannot 
neutralize  the  fiscal  and  financial  risks  that  the  country  faces.  It  certainly  cannot  fine-tune 
economic outcomes.  
As we assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy approaches, though, we must not 
lose sight of the daunting economic challenges that confront our nation. The stagnation of 
the labor market in particular is a grave concern not only because of the enormous suffering

and  waste  of  human  talent  it  entails,  but  also  because  persistently  high  levels  of 
unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.  
Over  the  past five  years,  the  Federal  Reserve  has  acted  to  support  economic  growth  and 
foster  job  creation,  and  it  is  important  to  achieve  further  progress,  particularly  in  the  labor 
market.  Taking  due  account  of  the  uncertainties  and  limits  of  its  policy  tools,  the  Federal 
Reserve  will  provide  additional  policy  accommodation  as  needed  to  promote  a  stronger 
economic  recovery  and  sustained  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  in  a  context  of 
price stability.
