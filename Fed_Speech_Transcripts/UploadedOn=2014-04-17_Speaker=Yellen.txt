  Janet L Yellen: Monetary policy and the economic recovery 
Speech by Ms Janet L Yellen, Chair of the United States’ Federal Reserve System, at the 
Economic Club of New York, New York, 16 April 2014. 
 Nearly  five  years  into  the  expansion  that  began  after  the  financial  crisis  and  the  Great 
Recession, the recovery has come a long way. More than 8 million jobs have been added to 
nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number lost as a result of the recession. Led 
by  a  resurgent  auto  industry,  manufacturing  output  has  also  nearly  returned  to  its  pre-
recession  peak.  While  the  housing  market  still  has  far  to  go,  it  seems  to  have  turned  a 
corner. 
It is a sign of how far the economy has come that a return to full employment is, for the first 
time  since the  crisis,  in the medium-term  outlooks  of many forecasters. It  is  a  reminder of 
how far we have to go, however, that this long-awaited outcome is projected to be more than 
two years away. 
Today I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and 
I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our efforts to promote a 
return  to  maximum  employment  in  a  context  of  price  stability.  I  will  start  with  the  FOMC’s 
outlook,  which  foresees  a  gradual  return  over  the  next  two  to  three  years  of  economic 
conditions consistent with its mandate. 
While  monetary  policy  discussions  naturally  begin  with  a  baseline  outlook,  the  path  of  the 
economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant unexpected twists and 
turns the economy may take. My primary focus today will be on how the FOMC’s monetary 
policy framework has evolved to best support the recovery through those twists and turns, 
and what this framework is likely to imply as the recovery progresses. 
The current economic outlook 
The FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed from last fall. In 
recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to judge whether the 
data are signaling a material change in the outlook. The unusually harsh winter weather in 
much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my FOMC colleagues and I generally 
believe that a significant part of the recent softness was weather related. 
The continued improvement in labor market conditions has been important in this judgment. 
The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen three-tenths of 1 percentage point since 
late last year. Broader measures of unemployment that include workers marginally attached 
to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons have fallen a bit more 
than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation, which had been falling, 
has ticked up this year. 
Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, has slowed 
from an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent in early 2012 to less than 1 percent in February of 
this  year.1  This  rate  is  well  below  the  Committee’s  2  percent  longer-run  objective.  Many 
advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation. 
To  some  extent,  the  low  rate  of  inflation  seems  due  to  influences  that  are  likely  to  be 
temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices and outright declines in core 
import prices in recent quarters. Longer-run inflation expectations have remained remarkably

  steady, however. We anticipate that, as the effects of transitory factors subside and as labor 
market gains continue, inflation will gradually move back toward 2 percent. 
In sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the unemployment rate at 
the  end  of  2016  is  5.2  to  5.6  percent,  and  for  inflation  the  central  tendency  is  1.7  to 
2 percent.2 If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would be approaching what 
my  colleagues  and  I  view  as  maximum  employment  and  price  stability  for  the  first  time  in 
nearly a decade. I find this baseline outlook quite plausible. 
Of course, if the economy obediently followed our forecasts, the job of central bankers would 
be a lot easier and their speeches would be a lot shorter. Alas, the economy is often not so 
compliant, so I will ask your indulgence for a few more minutes. 
Three big questions for the FOMC 
Because the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policymakers need to carefully 
watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline outlook and then respond in a systematic 
way. Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe are likely to loom 
large  in  the  FOMC’s  ongoing  assessment  of  where  we  are  on  the  path  back to  maximum 
employment and price stability. 
Is there still significant slack in the labor market? 
The  first  question  concerns  the  extent  of  slack  in  the  labor  market.  One  of  the  FOMC’s 
objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what conditions are 
consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess. Thus far in the recovery and 
to  this  day,  there  is  little  question  that  the  economy  has  remained  far  from  maximum 
employment,  so measurement  difficulties  were  not  our focus.  But  as the  attainment  of  our 
maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be necessary for the FOMC to form a more 
nuanced judgment about when the recovery of the labor market will be materially complete. 
As  the  FOMC’s  statement  on  longer-term  goals  and  policy  strategy  emphasizes,  these 
judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a wide range of indicators.3 
I  will  refer  to  the  shortfall  in  employment  relative  to  its  mandate-consistent  level  as  labor 
market slack, and there are a number of different indicators of this slack. Probably the best 
single  indicator  is  the  unemployment  rate.  At  6.7  percent,  it  is  now  slightly  more  than 
1 percentage  point  above  the  5.2  to  5.6  percent  central  tendency  of  the  Committee’s 
projections for the longer-run normal unemployment rate. This shortfall remains significant, 
and in our baseline outlook, it will take more than two years to close.4 
Other  data  suggest  that  there  may  be  more  slack  in  labor  markets  than  indicated  by  the 
unemployment  rate.  For  example,  the  share  of  the  workforce that  is  working  part  time  but 
would prefer to work full time remains quite high by historical standards. Similarly, while the 
share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have been looking for work for 
more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it remains as high as any time prior to 
the Great Recession.5 There is ongoing debate about why long-term unemployment remains 
                                                
2   These figures are based on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in conjunction with the 
March  2014  FOMC  meeting. The  SEP  is  an  addendum  to the  FOMC  minutes  and  is  available at  Board  of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 
18–19, 2014,” press release, April 9.

January 28, 2014, which is available on the Board’s website.

5   The share in CPS employment of persons working part time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent prior to 
the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5 percent. The share in

  so high and the degree to which it might decline in a more robust economy. As I argued more 
fully  in  a  recent  speech,  I  believe  that  long-term  unemployment  might  fall  appreciably  if 
economic conditions were stronger.6 
The low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is not reflected 
in  the  headline  unemployment  rate.  Participation  would  be  expected  to fall  because  of  the 
aging  of  the  population,  but  the  decline  steepened  in  the  recovery.  Although  economists 
differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market might join or rejoin the labor 
force in a stronger economy, my own view is that some portion of the decline in participation 
likely represents labor market slack.7 
Lastly,  economists  also  look  to  wage  pressures  to  signal  a  tightening  labor  market.  At 
present, wage gains continue to proceed at a historically slow pace in this recovery, with few 
signs  of  a  broad-based  acceleration.  As  the  extent  of  slack  we  see  today  diminishes, 
however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market indicators closely to 
judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative monetary policy should 
be. 
Is inflation moving back toward 2 percent? 
A second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the recovery is whether 
inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run objective, as envisioned in 
our baseline outlook. As the most recent FOMC statement emphasizes, inflation persistently 
below 2 percent could pose risks to economic performance. 
The FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below its 2 percent objective because, at 
very  low  inflation  rates,  adverse  economic  developments  could  more  easily  push  the 
economy  into  deflation.  The  limited  historical  experience  with  deflation  shows  that,  once  it 
starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged periods of very weak 
economic performance.8 
A persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well. With the federal funds rate 
currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value for the federal 
funds  rate,  limiting  the  capacity  of  monetary  policy  to  support  the  economy.9  Further,  with 
longer-term  inflation  expectations  anchored  near  2  percent  in  recent  years,  persistent 
                                                                                                                                                   
the  labor  force  of  those  unemployed  for  more  than  26  weeks  rose  from  less  than  1  percent  prior  to  the 
recession to 4.5 percent, and it has since declined to just below 2.5 percent; the previous peak for this series 
was 2.5 percent in 1983. The records for long-term unemployed begin in 1948.

reflects  cyclical  factors  is  expressed  by  Christopher  J.  Erceg  and  Andrew  T.  Levin  (2013),  “Labor  Force

If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer-term interest rates, temporarily higher 
short-term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained by the 
zero lower bound would have little economic effects, provided that these higher short-term real interest rates 
would be expected to be compensated by lower short-term real interest rates later on. However, to the extent 
that  these  spending  decisions  depend  in  part  on  shorter-term  real  interest  rates,  low  inflation  can  induce 
meaningful economic costs.

  inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden of debt for households and 
firms, which may put a drag on economic activity. 
I will mention two considerations that will be important in assessing whether inflation is likely 
to  move  back  to  2  percent  as  the  economy  recovers.  First,  we  anticipate  that,  as  labor 
market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation. However, during the recovery, 
very  high  levels  of  slack  have  seemingly  not  generated  strong  downward  pressure  on 
inflation. We must therefore watch carefully to see whether diminishing slack is helping return 
inflation  to  our  objective.10  Second,  our  baseline  projection  rests  on  the  view  that  inflation 
expectations will remain well anchored near 2 percent and provide a natural pull back to that 
level.  But  the  strength  of  that  pull  in  the  unprecedented  conditions  we  continue  to  face  is 
something we must continue to assess. 
Finally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise substantially above 
2 percent. At present, I rate the chances of this happening as significantly below the chances 
of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must always be prepared to respond to such 
unexpected outcomes, which leads us to my third question. 
What factors may push the recovery off track? 
Myriad factors continuously buffet the economy, so the Committee must always be asking, 
“What factors may be pushing the recovery off track?” For example, over the nearly 5 years 
of the recovery, the economy has been affected by greater-than-expected fiscal drag in the 
United States and by spillovers from the sovereign debt and banking problems of some euro-
area  countries.  Further,  our  baseline  outlook  has  changed  as  we  have  learned  about  the 
degree of structural damage to the economy wrought by the crisis and the subsequent pace 
of healing. 
Let me offer an example of how these issues shape policy. Four years ago, in April 2010, the 
outlook  appeared fairly  bright. The  emergency  lending  programs  that  the  Federal  Reserve 
implemented at the height of the crisis had been largely wound down, and the Fed was soon 
to complete its first large-scale asset purchase program. Private-sector forecasters polled in 
the  April  2010  Blue  Chip  survey  were  predicting  that  the  unemployment  rate  would  fall 
steadily to 8.6 percent in the final quarter of 2011.11 
This forecast  proved  quite  accurate  –  the  unemployment  rate  averaged  8.6  percent  in  the 
fourth quarter of 2011. But this was not the whole story. In April 2010, Blue Chip forecasters 
not only expected falling unemployment, they also expected the FOMC to soon begin raising 
the federal funds rate. Indeed, they expected the federal funds rate to reach 1.3 percent by 
the  second  quarter  of  2011.12  By  July  2010,  however,  with  growth  disappointing  and  the 
FOMC  expressing  concerns  about  softening  in  both  growth  and  inflation,  the  Blue  Chip 
                                                
10   The uncertainty surrounding the empirical relationship between slack and inflation is discussed in James H. 
Stock and Mark W. Watson (2009), “Phillips Curve Inflation Forecasts,” in Jeff Fuhrer, Yolanda K. Kodrzycki, 
Jane Sneddon Little, and Giovanni P. Olivei, eds., Understanding Inflation and the Implications for Monetary 
Policy: A Phillips Curve Retrospective (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press). Moreover, with the share of long-term 
unemployed in total unemployment unusually elevated in recent years, there is an ongoing discussion about 
whether  short-  and  long-term  unemployment  have  differential  effects  on  inflation.  See  Robert  J.  Gordon 
(2013),  “The  Phillips  Curve  Is  Alive  and  Well:  Inflation  and  the  NAIRU  during  the  Slow  Recovery,”  NBER

Review.

similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the end of 2011 
submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to 8.5 percent. See Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, April

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  forecast of the federal funds rate in mid-2011 had fallen to 0.8 percent, and by October the 
forecasters  expected  that  the  rate  would  remain  in  the  range  of  0  to  25  basis  points 
throughout 2011, as turned out to be the case.13 Not only did expectations of policy tightening 
recede,  the  FOMC  also  initiated  a  new  $600  billion  asset  purchase  program  in  November 
2010. 
Thus, while the reductions in the unemployment rate through 2011 were roughly as forecast 
in  early  2010,  this  improvement  only  came  about  with  the  FOMC  providing  a  considerably 
higher level of accommodation than originally anticipated. 
This  experience  was  essentially  repeated  the  following  year.  In  April  2011,  Blue  Chip 
forecasters  expected  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  to  7.9  percent  by  the  fourth  quarter  of 
2012,  with  the  FOMC  expected  to  have  already  raised  the  federal  funds  rate  to  near 
1 percent by mid-2012.14 
As it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably accurate, but 
again  this  was  associated  with  considerably  more  accommodation  than  anticipated.  In 
response to signs of slowing economic activity, in August 2011 the FOMC for the first time 
expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating that conditions would likely 
warrant  exceptionally  low  levels  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  least  through  mid-2013.  The 
following month, the Committee added to accommodation by adopting a new balance sheet 
policy known as the maturity extension program.15 
Thus, in both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about as much as 
had  been  forecast  the  previous  year,  but  only  after  unexpected  weakness  prompted 
additional  accommodative  steps  by  the  Federal  Reserve.  In  both  cases,  I  believe  that  the 
FOMC’s decision to respond to signs of weakness with significant additional accommodation 
played an important role in helping to keep the projected labor market recovery on track.16 
These  episodes  illustrate  what  I  described  earlier  as  a  vital  aspect  of  effective  monetary 
policymaking:  monitor  the  economy  for  signs  that  events  are  unfolding  in  a  materially 
different manner than expected and adjust policy in response in a systematic manner. Now I 
will turn from the task of monitoring to the policy response. 
Policy challenges in an unprecedented recovery 
Fundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary policy is more 
effective  when  the  public  better  understands  and  anticipates  how  the  central  bank  will 
respond to evolving economic conditions. Specifically, it is important for the central bank to 
make  clear  how  it  will  adjust  its  policy  stance  in  response  to  unforeseen  economic

Publishers (2010), vol. 29, no. 10 (October 1). In the statement following its August 10, 2010, meeting, the 
FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent months.” See Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press release, August 10. See also the

16   There are a range of estimates on the effectiveness of these policies. A review is provided in Ben S. Bernanke 
(2012),  “Monetary  Policy  since  the  Onset  of  the  Crisis,”  speech  delivered  at  “The  Changing  Policy 
Landscape,”  a  symposium  sponsored  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Kansas  City,  held  in  Jackson  Hole,

  developments  in  a  manner  that reduces  or  blunts  potentially  harmful  consequences. If  the 
public  understands  and  expects  policymakers  to  behave  in  this  systematically  stabilizing 
manner, it will tend to respond less to such developments. Monetary policy will thus have an 
“automatic stabilizer” effect that operates through private-sector expectations. It is important 
to note that tying the response of policy to the economy necessarily makes the future course 
of the federal funds rate uncertain. But by responding to changing circumstances, policy can 
be most effective at reducing uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment. 
Recall how this worked during the couple of decades before the crisis – a period sometimes 
known as the Great Moderation. The FOMC’s main policy tool, the federal funds rate, was 
well  above  zero,  leaving  ample  scope  to  respond  to  the  modest  shocks  that  buffeted  the 
economy during that period. Many studies confirmed that the appropriate response of policy 
to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of accuracy by a simple rule linking the 
federal  funds  rate  to  the  shortfall  or  excess  of  employment  and  inflation  relative  to  their 
desired values.17 The famous Taylor rule provides one such formula.18 
The  idea  that  monetary  policy  should  react  in  a  systematic  manner  in  order  to  blunt  the 
effects  of  shocks  has  remained  central  in  the  FOMC’s  policymaking  during  this  recovery. 
However, the application of this idea has been more challenging. With the federal funds rate 
pinned near zero, the FOMC has been forced to rely on two less familiar policy tools – the 
first one being forward guidance regarding the future setting of the federal funds rate and the 
second  being  large-scale  asset  purchases.  There  are  no  time-tested  guidelines  for  how 
these  tools  should  be  adjusted  in  response  to  changes  in  the  outlook.  As  the  episodes 
recounted  earlier  illustrate,  the  FOMC  has  continued  to  try  to  adjust  its  policy  tools  in  a 
systematic manner in response to new information about the economy. But because both the 
tools  and  the  economic  conditions  have  been  unfamiliar,  it  has  also  been  critical  that  the 
FOMC communicate how it expects to deploy its tools in response to material changes in the 
outlook. 
Let  me  review  some  important  elements  in  the  evolution  of  the  FOMC’s  communication 
framework.  When 
tools,  policy 
communication  was  relatively  simple.  In  December  2008,  for  example,  the  FOMC  said  it 
expected that conditions would warrant keeping the federal funds rate near zero for “some 
time.” This period before the “liftoff” in the federal funds rate was described in increasingly 
specific, and (as it turned out) longer, periods over time – “some time” became “an extended 
period,”  which  was  later  changed  to  “mid-2013,”  then  “late  2014,”  then  “mid-2015.”19  This 
fixed,  calendar-based  guidance  had  the  virtue  of  simplicity,  but  it  lacked  the  automatic 
stabilizer property of communication that would signal how and why the stance of policy and 
forward  guidance  might  change  as  developments  unfolded,  and  as  we  learned  about  the 
extent of the need for accommodation.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  More recently, the Federal Reserve, and I might add, other central banks around the world, 
have  sought  to  incorporate  this  automatic  stabilizer  feature  in  their  communications.20  In 
December 2012, the Committee reformulated its forward guidance, stating that it anticipated 
that the federal funds rate would remain near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate 
remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead 
was projected to be no more than half a percentage point above the Committee’s objective, 
and  longer-term  inflation  expectations  continued  to  be  well  anchored.  This  guidance 
emphasized to the public that it could count on a near-zero federal funds rate at least until 
substantial progress in the recovery had been achieved, however long that might take. When 
these thresholds were announced, the unemployment rate was reported to be 7.7 percent, 
and  the  Committee  projected  that  the  6-1/2  percent  threshold  would  not  be  reached  for 
another 2-1/2 years – in mid-2015. The Committee emphasized that these numerical criteria 
were  not  triggers  for  raising  the  federal  funds  rate,  and  Chairman  Bernanke  stated  that, 
ultimately, any decision to begin removing accommodation would be based on a wide range 
of indicators.21 
Our communications about asset purchases have undergone a similar transformation. The 
initial asset purchase programs had fixed time and quantity limits, although those limits came 
with a proviso that they might be adjusted. In the fall of 2012, the FOMC launched its current 
purchase program, this time explicitly tying the course of the program to evolving economic 
conditions. When the program began, the rate of purchases was $85 billion per month, and 
the  Committee  indicated  that  purchases  would  continue,  providing  that  inflation  remained 
well behaved, until there was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.22 
Based on the cumulative progress toward maximum employment since the initiation of the 
program and the improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the FOMC began reducing 
the  pace  of  asset  purchases  last  December,  stating  that  “[i]f  incoming  information  broadly 
supports  the  Committee’s  expectation  of  ongoing  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions 
and inflation moving back toward its longer-term objective, the Committee will likely reduce 
the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.”23 Purchases are 
currently  proceeding  at  a  pace  of  $55  billion  per  month.  Consistent  with  my  theme  today, 
however, the FOMC statement underscores that purchases are not on a preset course – the 
FOMC stands ready to adjust the pace of purchases as warranted should the outlook change 
materially. 
Recent changes to the forward guidance 
At our most recent meeting in March, the FOMC reformulated its forward guidance for the 
federal  funds  rate.  While  one  of  the  main  motivations  for  this  change  was  that  the 
unemployment rate might soon cross the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the new formulation is also 
well  suited  to  help  the  FOMC  explain  policy  adjustments  that  may  arise  in  response  to 
changes in the outlook. I should note that the change in the forward guidance did not indicate 
a  change  in  the  Committee’s  policy  intentions,  but  instead  was  made  to  clarify  the 
Committee’s thinking about policy as the economy continues to recover. The new guidance 
                                                
20   The  Bank  of  England  introduced  threshold-based  forward  guidance  in  August  2013  and  adopted  more-
qualitative  forward  guidance  in  February  2014;  see  Bank  of  England,  “Forward  Guidance,”  webpage.  The 
European  Central  Bank  recently  linked  its  forward  guidance  more  explicitly  to  its  assessment  of  economic 
slack, as discussed in President Mario Draghi’s press conference on March 6, 2014; see Mario Draghi (2014),

  provides  a  general  description  of  the  framework  that  the  FOMC  will  apply  in  making 
decisions  about  the  timing  of  liftoff.  Specifically,  in  determining  how  long  to  maintain  the 
current  target  range  of 0  to  25  basis  points for  the federal funds rate, “the  Committee  will 
assess progress, both realized and expected, toward its objectives of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation.”24 In other words, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation 
from  their  respective  objectives,  and  the  slower  the  projected  progress  toward  those 
objectives,  the  longer  the  current  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  likely  to  be 
maintained. This approach underscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain 
the appropriate degree of accommodation to support the recovery. The new guidance also 
reaffirms  the  FOMC’s  view  that  decisions  about  liftoff  should  not  be  based  on  any  one 
indicator, but that it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, 
inflation, and financial developments. 
Along  with  this  general  framework,  the  FOMC  provided  an  assessment  of  what  that 
framework  implies  for  the  likely  path  of  policy  under  the  baseline  outlook.  At  present,  the 
Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely warrant maintaining 
the current range “for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase 
program  ends,  especially  if  projected  inflation  continues  to  run  below  the  Committee’s 
2 percent  longer-run  goal,  and  provided  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations  remain  well 
anchored.”25 
Finally,  the  Committee  began  explaining  more  fully  how  policy  may  operate  in  the  period 
after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some time, warrant 
keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as likely to prove normal 
in the longer run. FOMC participants have cited different reasons for this view, but many of 
the  reasons  involve  persistent  effects  of  the  financial  crisis  and  the  possibility  that  the 
productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at least for a time, than it did, on 
average, before the crisis. The expectation that the achievement of our economic objectives 
will  likely  require  low  real  interest  rates  for  some  time  is  again  not  confined  to  the  United 
States but is shared broadly across many advanced economies.26 Of course, this guidance is 
a forecast and will evolve as we gain further evidence about how the economy is operating in 
the wake of the crisis and ensuing recession. 
Conclusion 
In  summary,  the  policy  framework  I  have  described  reflects  the  FOMC’s  commitment  to 
systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to promote a return to 
maximum employment in a context of price stability. 
It is very welcome news that a return to these conditions has finally appeared in the medium-
term  outlook  of  many  forecasters.  But  it  will  be  much  better  news  when  this  objective  is 
reached. My colleagues on the FOMC and I will stay focused on doing the Federal Reserve’s 
part to promote this goal.
