Ben S Bernanke: Financial literacy Statement by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  provided for the record of a hearing held on 12 April 2011 conducted by the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management  the Federal Workforce  and the District of Columbia  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  US Senate  Washington DC  20 April 2011. Chairman Akaka  Ranking Member Johnson  and members of the Subcommittee  thank you for inviting me to submit a statement for the record. As April is Financial Literacy Month  I am pleased to highlight the importance of financial literacy to a stable and healthy economy and to describe some of the Federal Reserve System’s efforts to help Americans make informed financial decisions. The recent crisis demonstrated the critical importance of financial literacy and good financial decisionmaking  both for the economic welfare of households and for the soundness and stability of the system as a whole. Good financial choices depend on reliable and useful information  presented in an understandable way. Essential components of personal financial management include an understanding of how to budget strategically  use credit  save to build personal wealth  and shop for and choose suitable financial products. The Federal Reserve recognizes that informed  educated consumers not only achieve better outcomes for themselves but  through careful shopping for and use of financial products  help to increase market efficiency and innovation. Our approach to assisting consumers to successfully navigate the financial marketplace has been three-pronged: First  we have worked diligently to foster financial and economic education. Second  we conduct research on consumer decisionmaking that helps to identify what works in financial education and informs the regulatory process. Third  in recognition that basic financial knowledge is not sufficient to safeguard people from fraud and deceptive practices  we have promulgated strong consumer protection rules and consumer-tested required financial product disclosures to ensure they present information clearly and in a useful format. We vigorously enforce consumer protection laws to ensure that providers of consumer financial products act fairly and comply with the spirit and letter of the rules. Financial and economic education In our dynamic and complex financial marketplace  financial education must be a life-long pursuit that enables consumers of all ages and economic positions to stay attuned to changes in their financial needs and circumstances and to take advantage of products and services that best meet their goals. Well-informed consumers  who can serve as their own advocates  are one of the best lines of defense against the proliferation of financial products and services that are unsuitable  unnecessarily costly  or abusive. Financial education from the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve has provided unbiased  credible  research-based financial information and educational materials  in print and on the Internet  for many years. We offer publications – in both English and Spanish – that provide consumers tips on a broad range of topics  from avoiding mortgage foreclosure scams to managing a checking account. More recently  the Federal Reserve Board has developed interactive webpages with up-to-date information on regulatory changes that affect consumer financial products and services. These webpages offer information in plain language and in an easy-to-understand format; they also provide links to calculators  additional resources  and other relevant material. The Board’s “What You BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 Need to Know” series provides user-friendly information and tools about new terms  disclosures  and protections for credit card accounts  overdraft protection programs  gift cards  credit decisions and credit scores  and notices of mortgage transfers.1 Since the series webpage was launched in February 2010  more than 366 000 web views have been logged  with 60 percent of those visits for credit card information. The Federal Reserve Banks  through their Community Affairs offices  have developed financial education materials and programs on topics that range from establishing banking accounts to building wealth. For example  the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  as part of Financial Literacy Month  offers free classes and activities during its “Money Smart Week.” In events developed in cooperation with local organizations and firms  young people and adults learn about financial matters ranging from opening a savings account to applying for a mortgage. Several Federal Reserve Banks are also actively involved in “Bank On” programs that help cities and financial institutions bring unbanked and underbanked consumers into the financial mainstream by educating them about the benefits of having a bank account and using other banking services. Exposing young people to financial concepts is particularly important. Students can be particularly vulnerable to the temptations of taking on excessive debt  such as credit card debt. And the earlier that young people can develop basic financial skills  the more likely it is that they will make good financial decisions when they become adults. The Federal Reserve is committed to helping teachers and schools work more effectively with students as they develop their financial literacy. For example  the Federal Reserve provides a financial and economic education website with a variety of resources for teachers  and students of various ages and knowledge levels.2 The site offers educational games  classroom lesson plans  online publications  and multimedia tools. Federal Reserve Banks offer teachers professional development opportunities to improve their ability to teach personal finance topics. A number of Federal Reserve Banks also organize personal finance essay  video  and academic competitions for students. We encourage students and teachers to visit Federal Reserve Bank learning centers and museums  which feature interactive exhibits about many aspects of banking  the financial system  and the economy. Collaboration in financial education In addition to conducting its own programs  the Federal Reserve collaborates with numerous organizations and agencies that educate and counsel individuals from a broad range of audiences. Our long-standing partnership and role on the board of NeighborWorks America supports homebuyer  foreclosure  and mortgage modification counseling to lower-income consumers and communities. We have helped these and other organizations – such as American Savings Education Council  Junior Achievement  the Council for Economic Education  the National Endowment for Financial Education  and America Saves – develop  implement  and evaluate personal finance awareness and education programs. In addition  we have worked with the Jump$tart Coalition  American Library Association  the AARP  the National Council of La Raza  the National Association of School Boards  and the Congressional Black Caucus to increase awareness of our financial and economic education resources. We also collaborate with other federal government agencies on education and outreach initiatives. Since 2004  the Board has participated in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC)  which is composed of representatives from 22 federal agencies and coordinates financial education resources offered by the federal government. To support the 1 See Board  “What You Need to Know Series.” 2 See the Federal Reserve Education website. 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches FLEC’s mission  Board staff members have served on Commission task forces to develop its website  national strategy  and research agenda. Research and evaluation As part of our policy research mission  the Federal Reserve dedicates considerable resources to the study of consumer economics and consumer behavior. Our work includes the development of valuable new data and empirical studies in these areas. For example  for many decades the Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances has provided one of the most important sources of information on the assets  debts  and wealth of American households.3 The Federal Reserve has also developed substantial expertise in assessing and drawing policy conclusions from a range of consumer financial data  such as data from credit records or data on mortgages provided by lenders under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The Federal Reserve has been involved in studying the efficacy of financial education in helping people make better financial decisions. For example  several years ago  researchers in the Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs joined with Army Emergency Relief to conduct a longitudinal study of the effect of a two-day financial education program on soldiers’ financial management. In general  studies show that financial education for young adults is most effective when it is both timely and relevant. At the same time  research has also provided important insight into other factors that contribute to the development of personal financial skills  such as general education levels  family experiences and parental influence  access to financial services (for example  having a savings account while growing up)  and income level.4 These findings underscore the importance of early and ongoing education as well as experience with financial products in helping people make good financial choices. We have also analyzed alternative approaches to financial education. For example  the economic education staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia investigated the effectiveness of a personal finance course that uses a specific curriculum  “Keys to Financial Success.” This semester-long course is taught by teachers who attended a 30-hour training course. A 50-question exam administered before and after the course showed that students who took the course had a statistically significant increase in their personal finance achievement  compared with a control group of students of the same age who were not exposed to the program.5 3 The Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances. 4 See Catherine Bell  Daniel Gorin  and (2009)  Jeanne M.

BIS central bankers’ speeches 3 Consumer protection regulation and enforcement Although financial education is a critical first line of defense  it is not a substitute for strong and effective regulations that safeguard consumers against abusive and fraudulent practices. The Board has been the primary federal agency charged with writing rules governing consumer financial products  and in recent years  we have issued rules for mortgages  credit cards  student loans  and overdraft protection programs  among others. We have also maintained a robust compliance program to ensure that banks under our purview adhere to these rules. As you know  our consumer-protection rulemaking authority and our consumer-protection supervisory and enforcement authority over some of the nation’s largest financial institutions will transfer to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection  pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Board will retain some relevant rule- writing authorities (for example  under the Community Reinvestment Act) as well as supervisory authorities for smaller financial institutions that we also regulate for safety-and- soundness purposes. We are working closely with the Department of the Treasury and the new Bureau to facilitate the necessary transfers of authorities and personnel. Regardless of how the regulatory and supervisory responsibilities are distributed  a comprehensive approach – one that includes education  research  and regulation – remains essential to ensuring that consumers receive adequate protections and that markets for consumer financial products function well. The Board will work collaboratively with the Bureau and other agencies to help individuals and families make the best choices for their financial futures. For your reference  I am attaching some examples of financial literacy programs and outreach that are available from the Federal Reserve. 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches Appendix A Federal Reserve System community affairs offices Financial education for consumers and communities The 12 Federal Reserve Banks offer a broad range of programs for nonprofit organizations  government agencies  and financial institutions that work to improve financial education and access to services for lower-income consumers and communities.
