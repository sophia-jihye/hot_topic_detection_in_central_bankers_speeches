Ben S Bernanke: Community development financial institutions – promoting economic growth and opportunity Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the Opportunity Finance Network’s Annual Conference  Washington  DC  1 November 2006. Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to your annual conference. Since I assumed my new responsibilities earlier this year  as well as during my earlier stint at the Federal Reserve as a member of the Board of Governors  I have met numerous times with community development leaders to discuss both their achievements and the challenges they face. In visiting some underserved communities  I have seen first-hand the effects of various development initiatives. I have also regularly attended the meetings of the Board’s Consumer Advisory Council  which brings together community representatives and lenders to discuss a range of consumer and community development issues. These experiences have helped me appreciate the many ways that community development financial institutions (CDFIs) work to strengthen communities and improve the lives of lower-income people. Ensuring that every American has the chance to improve his or her economic circumstances through hard work  saving  entrepreneurship  and other productive activities is essential for building healthy communities and achieving sustainable economic growth. The Federal Reserve and the CDFI community share a common interest in increasing economic opportunity for all Americans. The Federal Reserve supports local economic development  for example  through its active engagement in financial literacy programs  through its community outreach efforts  through aspects of its role in regulating banking and financial markets  and by its research in regional economics. But the Fed’s central mission - to help maintain a financial and macroeconomic environment that fosters price stability and maximum sustainable employment - is of necessity focused on the economic performance of the nation as a whole. Monetary policy is a blunt tool that cannot target industries  population groups  or regions. In contrast  as you know  CDFIs operate primarily at the microeconomic level  community by community. Using techniques such as financial counseling  local market research  and specialized lending  CDFIs work with partners in both the public and the private sectors to help unlock the economic potential of lower-income and underserved communities. The theme of my remarks today is our shared goal of increasing economic opportunity. I will first discuss some of the progress that has been made in recent years in the economic situations of lower- income households and communities as well as some of the important challenges that remain. I will also offer my perspective on how CDFIs and their partners can help to meet those challenges. Improvements in economic opportunity and some challenges In the past decade or so  U.S. households overall have experienced notable gains in terms of some key indicators of economic opportunity. Three such indicators that I will briefly discuss are access to credit  rates of homeownership  and small business development. Moreover  as measured by these indicators  recent improvements in traditionally underserved markets appear to have been as great as or greater than those in middle- and upper-income households and communities. At the same time  however  the gaps between lower-income households and other households with respect to these measures of opportunity remain wide. Access to credit Access to credit is an important element of economic opportunity and community economic development: It supports homeownership and small-business creation and provides greater financial flexibility for households. In recent years  advances in information and communication technologies  improved methods of risk measurement and risk assessment  the availability of more-comprehensive information about individuals’ credit histories  and an increased ability of retail lenders to obtain funds from capital markets have led to what has been called the “democratization” of credit. As the pricing of credit risk has become more sophisticated and more consistent  as scale economies have reduced costs  and as funding sources have increased  lenders have been able to extend credit to households and businesses that might previously have been considered uncreditworthy. BIS Review 103/2006 1 The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households  including those with lower incomes. In 1994  fewer than 5 percent of mortgage originations were in the subprime market  but by 2005 about 20 percent of new mortgage loans were subprime.1 Indeed  the expansion of subprime lending has contributed importantly to the substantial increase in the overall use of mortgage credit. From 1995 to 2004  the share of households with mortgage debt increased 17 percent  and in the lowest income quintile  the share of households with mortgage debt rose 53 percent.2 Although the emergence of risk-based pricing has increased access to credit for all households  it has also raised some concerns and questions  which are magnified in the case of lower-income borrowers. For example  although subprime lending has grown substantially  are prime credit products sufficiently available and do lenders effectively compete in all communities  including historically underserved communities? How well are lower-income borrowers matched with credit products and loan terms that fit their circumstances? Are borrowers aware of the terms and conditions of their loans  and more generally  are consumers sufficiently well informed to be wary of potentially misleading marketing tactics and to shop effectively among lenders? Some evidence  including recent Federal Reserve research on consumers holding adjustable-rate mortgages  suggests that awareness could be improved  particularly among borrowers with lower incomes and education levels.3 This research suggests the need for greater financial literacy and increased access to financial counseling  a point to which I will return. The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different  but potentially related  concern about access to credit on equal terms. The data show that blacks and Hispanics are considerably more likely than other borrowers to receive higher-priced loans.4 This finding has several possible - and not mutually exclusive - explanations  ranging from illegal discrimination to the effects of legitimate pricing factors not captured in the HMDA data  such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower credit history. Of course  as an agency committed to the rigorous enforcement of the fair lending laws  our job is to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate sources of pricing differentials among the banking institutions we supervise. In our enforcement efforts  we analyze the HMDA price disparities in conjunction with other information  such as the adequacy of the lender’s fair lending controls and the presence of business practices that may put lenders at risk for pricing discrimination. For example  a lender might offer its loan officers financial incentives that have the effect of inducing them to charge some applicants higher interest rates or to “steer” them to higher-priced loan products. Lenders at risk for pricing discrimination receive targeted reviews of their pricing to ensure that they are complying with fair lending laws. Loan price disparities  however  are not just a legal and supervisory issue. They also raise important social and policy concerns. The questions I raised earlier about access to prime products  lender competition  and borrower awareness and financial literacy may well be relevant to understanding the price disparities we observe. Further research to explore these questions and their possible connection to disparities in lending to members of minority groups would be highly worthwhile. In fact  the Federal Reserve’s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 1 Estimates are based on information from Inside Mortgage Finance Publications (2005 and earlier years)  Mortgage Market Statistical Annual (Bethesda  Md.: IMFP)  www.imfpubs.com 2 Calculations by Federal Reserve Board staff from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances  1995 and 2004.

The national rate of homeownership increased from 1995 through mid-2006  reaching nearly 69 percent of all households this year.6 All major racial and ethnic groups have made gains in homeownership  but in percentage terms the largest increases have been made by minority households. In particular  since 1995 the homeownership rate has increased 7 percent among white households  11 percent among black households  and 19 percent among Hispanic households. However  despite the relatively more rapid growth in minority homeownership  significant differences persist: For example  the homeownership rate for blacks and Hispanics remains about two-thirds the rate for non-Hispanic whites. As for homeownership in lower-income areas  the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances indicates that  from 1995 to 2004  census tracts in all income groupings experienced gains in homeownership  with rates in lower-income areas growing somewhat faster than those in higher- income areas.7 But  again  important gaps remain. For example  in 2004  the rate of homeownership in lower-income areas was roughly 47 percent  compared to 72 percent in middle-income areas. Small businesses Another area in which progress has been made both generally and in lower-income communities is small business development. Small businesses are essential to the economic well-being and vibrancy of local communities and of the U.S. economy as a whole. The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates that small businesses account for about half of private-sector output and employ more than half of private-sector workers.8 Moreover  because small businesses sometimes become big ones  small-business ownership can be a significant stepping stone for economic advancement  particularly in traditionally underserved populations. Between 1997 and 2002  the number of businesses owned by Asians  blacks  Hispanics  and women grew more than 20 percent for each group - more than twice the national rate of increase for all businesses.9 Nevertheless  small businesses face continual challenges. Each year  about half a million firms close  in some cases because of difficulties obtaining credit.10 Interestingly  the data do not indicate that experiences in obtaining credit differ greatly across neighborhoods of different income levels. According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Small Business Finances  for example  the proportions of businesses that were either denied credit or did not apply for fear of being turned down were similar across neighborhood income groups.11 to the economic gains factors have contributed CDFIs as a solution to market failures Many including broad macroeconomic forces and advances in the delivery of financial services. CDFIs have also played a valuable role by analyzing the economic potential of lower-income markets and developing strategies and marshaling resources to tap that potential. As CDFI leaders  you are keenly aware of the economic challenges that you work to overcome each day. Economists find it useful to think about these challenges in the context of the economics of market failure. Standard economic analysis tells us that when competitive conditions prevail in a market  the resulting prices induce firms and individuals to allocate resources in a manner that tends to maximize social welfare.12 However  economists also recognize that various deviations from I have cited  that 6 www.huduser.org/periodicals/ushmc.html 7 Calculations by Federal Reserve Board staff from the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances  1995 and 2004  www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/scfindex.html. 8 U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  www.sba.gov/advo/stats/sbfaq.pdf (91 KB PDF). 9 U.S. Census Bureau  Survey of Business Owners  www.census.gov/csd/sbo/. 10 U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  www.sba.gov/advo/stats/sbfaq.pdf (91 KB PDF). 11 Calculations by Federal Reserve staff from the Federal Reserve Board’s 2003 Survey of Small Business Finances.

Proceedings of the Second Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press)  pp. 507-32. BIS Review 103/2006 3 idealized market conditions  termed market failures  can inhibit the efficient allocation of resources.13 In one type of market failure  called a neighborhood externality  the actions of one person affect the well-being or economic welfare of others in the local area  but the individual taking the action neither bears the full costs of nor reaps the full benefits from those actions. Because the individual does not bear the full consequences of the actions taken  he or she may act in a way that is not in the best economic interest of the neighborhood as a whole. For example  the failure of some owners to maintain their properties can lower the value of well-maintained properties in the same neighborhood. Ultimately  such spillover effects from neglected properties can lead to underinvestment in the whole community  potentially harming all neighborhood residents and businesses. A related type of market failure studied by economists is known as an information externality. An information externality may arise when information about economic opportunities in an area has the potential to benefit many investors but is costly to gather. As a result  no single potential investor may find obtaining the data to be profitable. For example  on average  lower-income areas have fewer owner-occupied homes and record fewer home-purchase loans than higher-income areas do.14 Lower transaction activity makes accurately gauging property values and evaluating credit risks in those areas more difficult  which may inhibit the extension of credit.15 Alternatively  lower-income people may have shorter and more-irregular credit histories  making an evaluation of their individual creditworthiness more difficult and costly. Because a potential investor who bears the costs of obtaining data about underserved neighborhoods may be able to obtain only a portion of the full economic benefits  these data may remain uncollected.16 One purpose of CDFIs is to help overcome these and other market failures that inhibit local economic development. For example  by facilitating larger-scale property development projects  coordinating public and private investment efforts  and working to improve amenities and services in a local area  CDFIs may help to solve collective action problems and reduce neighborhood externalities. CDFIs can counter information externalities by assuming the cost of learning about their local communities and developing specialized financial products and services that better fit local needs. In general  CDFIs provide coordinated development activities and community-specific information that the market may not supply on its own. Among other benefits  the familiarity with each community that CDFIs develop can help to gauge and control risk.17 For example  the use by CDFIs of appraisers who specialize in evaluating properties in a particular community produces more-reliable estimates of the value of the loan collateral. Likewise  CDFIs structure loans and use public and private credit enhancements both to increase borrowers’ ability to qualify for loans and to spread the associated credit risk among a mix of private creditors and other providers of funds. Although these specialized techniques can reduce credit risk  they are labor-intensive and  consequently  expensive. Most private lending institutions reduce costs by adopting processes that are highly standardized and automated. Such systems are not necessarily compatible with lending to borrowers who require substantial screening  counseling  and monitoring or with acquiring specialized information about community development lending. Part of the explicit mission of CDFIs is to assume the costs of conducting such research and analyses in underserved communities. CDFIs have also developed techniques and strategies - such as flexible underwriting criteria  specialized loan products  and intensive financial education programs - to meet the financial circumstances of their communities. Moreover  in recent years  CDFIs have been working to expand their role as information brokers beyond the local communities they serve. Through national initiatives to collect industry-wide data and to securitize community development loan portfolios  CDFIs are working to expand access to credit 13 Paul Milgrom and John Roberts (1992)  Economics  Organization  and Management (Englewood Cliffs  N.J.: Prentice Hall). 14 The decennial census and annual HMDA data indicate  for example  that the average number of owner-occupied properties and home purchase loans in lower-income areas is less than half the average number in higher-income areas. 15 This argument is developed in detail in William W Lang and Leonard I Nakamura (1993)  “A Model of Redlining ” Journal of Urban Economics  vol. 33 (March)  pp. 223-34. 16 A detailed model of this phenomenon is in William C. Gruben  Jonathan A. Neuberger  and Ronald H. Schmidt (1990)  “Imperfect Information and the Community Reinvestment Act ” (2.7 MB PDF) Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  Economic Review  vol. 3 (Summer)  pp. 27-46. 17 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (1993)  Report to the Congress on Community Development Lending by Depository Institutions (Washington: Board of Governors  October). 4 BIS Review 103/2006 and capital in lower-income markets. In short  knowledge and expertise - together with the ability to build new relationships - are the principal contributions that CDFIs bring to the marketplace and to underserved communities. Is community development lending profitable? Can private-market participants profit from community development lending? Data based on Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) examinations tell us much about the volume of such loans but less about their performance and profitability. However  a Federal Reserve survey found that nearly all banks reported that their community development activities were profitable  at least to some degree.18 About two-thirds of the banks also reported receiving some benefit from their lending unrelated to loan profitability  such as an improved image in the community. Since the Federal Reserve report  studies undertaken by the CDFI Data Project show that  for 2004  charge-off rates for CDFI portfolios were similar to those for the banking industry as a whole.19 These studies and market data suggest that banks and other private organizations may become an increasingly significant source of competition for CDFIs. That is good news  not bad news. Indeed  the surest sign of a CDFI’s success is that private investors see viable investment opportunities in the neighborhoods in which the CDFI has been operating. The continuing relevance of CDFIs Although in some sense the mission of CDFIs is to make themselves unnecessary  I expect that the knowledge and good will that they have accumulated in local communities will continue to make them relevant. For example  I mentioned earlier the loan pricing disadvantages faced by members of minority groups that have appeared in the HMDA data. CDFIs may be able to help reduce those discrepancies by using their local knowledge and financial expertise to offer alternatives to conventional subprime lending. The Opportunity Finance Network  for instance  will be competing with subprime lenders via a mortgage-credit platform that centralizes some CDFI lending processes and directly links counseling and lending services. At the same time  CDFIs continue to expand their ability to attract private investment funds  for example  through increasing transparency and developing the means of providing objective evaluations of their financial and mission-related effectiveness. These efforts demonstrate the ability of CDFIs to adapt their business strategies to evolving markets  as indeed they have done throughout their thirty-year history. I expect that the local knowledge and specialized financial expertise that CDFIs provide will continue to add significant economic value and complement market forces in the support of community economic development. Thus  CDFIs are likely to contribute to our shared goal of expanding economic opportunity for many years to come. 18 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2000)  The Performance and Profitability of CRA-Related Lending  Report to the Congress submitted pursuant to section 713 of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999 (Washington: Board of Governors  July)  www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/surveys/craloansurvey/default.htm. 19 CDFI Coalition  CDFI Data Project  2004  www.cdfi.org/cdfiproj.asp#fy; and Elizabeth C Klee and Gretchen C Weinbach (2006)  “Profit and Balance Sheet Developments at U.S. Commercial Banks in 2005 ” Federal Reserve Bulletin  vol. 92 (June) www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2006/bankprofits/0606bankprofit.pdf (221 KB PDF).
