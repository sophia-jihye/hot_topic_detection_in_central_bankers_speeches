  Janet L Yellen: Inflation dynamics and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Ms  Janet  L  Yellen,  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System,  at  the  Philip  Gamble  Memorial  Lecture,  University  of  Massachusetts,  Amherst, 
Massachusetts, 24 September 2015. 
 I  would  like  to  thank  Michael  Ash  for  his  kind  introduction  and  the  University  of 
Massachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble Memorial 
Lecture. 
In my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s conduct of 
monetary policy. I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the United States since the 
1960s, highlighting two key points: that inflation is now much more stable than it used to be, 
and that it is currently running at a very low level. I will then consider the costs associated 
with  inflation,  and  why  these  costs  suggest  that  the  Federal  Reserve  should  try  to  keep 
inflation close to 2 percent. After briefly reviewing our policy actions since the financial crisis, 
I  will  discuss  the  dynamics  of  inflation  and their  implications for  the  outlook  and monetary 
policy. 
Historical review of inflation 
A crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate of increase 
in the prices of a broad group of goods and services. Keeping inflation stable at a moderately 
low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is high, excessively 
low,  or  unstable  imposes  significant  costs  on  households  and  businesses.  As  a  result, 
inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress has laid down for the Federal 
Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. 
The Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability element of 
its mandate. The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) – the measure of inflation that the Fed’s 
policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, uses to define its longer-
run inflation goal.1 Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation began to move higher. Large jumps in 
food and energy prices played a role in this upward move, but they were not the whole story, 
for, as illustrated here, inflation was already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit 
in the 1970s and the early 1980s.2 And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which 
excludes food and energy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s 
and rises to very elevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something 
more than the energy and food price shocks must have been at work. 
A  second  important  feature  of  inflation  over  this  period  can  be  seen  if  we  examine  an 
estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1. At each 
point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the level to

(PDF), available on the Board’s website. 
2   The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was the 
so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was caused 
by  disease  and  poor  harvests  combined  with  low  levels  of  inventories  (particularly  for  grains)  in  many 
countries.  The  second  energy  price  shock  resulted  from  a  jump  in  crude  oil  prices  following  the  1978–79 
revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely attributable to bad 
weather  and  disease.  (See  Blinder  and  Rudd,  2013,  for  an  assessment  of  the  effect  that  these  and  other 
special  factors  –  including  the  imposition  and  removal  of price controls  over  the  1971–74  period  –  had on 
consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)

which  inflation  is  projected  to return  in the  long run  once  the  effects  of any  shocks  to  the 
economy have fully played out.3 As can be seen from the figure, this estimated trend drifts 
higher  over  the  1960s  and  1970s,  implying  that  during  this  period  there  was  no  stable 
“anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return – a conclusion generally 
supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation. 
Today  many  economists  believe  that  these  features  of  inflation  in  the  late  1960s  and 
1970s  –  its  high  level  and  lack  of  a  stable  anchor  –  reflected  a  combination  of  factors, 
including  chronically  overheated  labor  and  product  markets,  the  effects  of  the  energy  and 
food  price  shocks,  and  the  emergence  of  an  “inflationary  psychology”  whereby  a  rise  in 
actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation. Together, these 
various  factors  caused  inflation  –  actual  and  expected  –  to  ratchet  higher  over  time. 
Ultimately,  however,  monetary  policy  bears  responsibility  for  the  broad  contour  of  what 
happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve 
was  insufficiently  focused  on  returning  inflation  to  a  predictable,  low  level  following  the 
shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances. 
In late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy to reduce 
inflation. In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic downturn in the 
early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less than 4 percent from 
1983 to 1990. Inflation came down further following the 1990–91 recession and subsequent 
slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many years. Since the recession ended 
in 2009, however, the United States has experienced inflation running appreciably below the 
FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting the gradual pace of the subsequent economic 
recovery. 
Examining  the  behavior  of  inflation’s  estimated  long-term  trend  reveals  another  important 
change  in  inflation  dynamics.  With  the  caveat  that  these  results  are  based  on  a  specific 
implementation  of  a  particular  statistical  model,  they  imply  that  since  the  mid-1990s  there 
have  been  no  persistent  movements  in  this  predicted  long-run  inflation  rate,  which  has 
remained very close to 2 percent. Remarkably, this stability is estimated to have continued 
during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the unemployment rate rise to levels 
comparable  to  those  seen  during  the  1981–82  downturn,  when  the  trend  did  shift  down 
markedly.4  As  I  will  discuss,  the  stability  of  this  trend  appears  linked  to  a  change  in  the 
behavior of long-run inflation expectations – measures of which appear to be much better 
anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an improvement in the conduct of monetary 
policy. In any event, this empirical analysis implies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has 
been much more predictable over the longer term than it was back in the 1970s because the 
trend  rate  to  which  inflation  was  predicted  to  return  no  longer  moved  around  appreciably. 
That said, inflation still varied considerably from year to year in response to various shocks. 
As figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on average since 
the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has proven difficult to 
fully  counter  with  monetary  policy.  Overall  inflation  (shown  as  the  dashed  red  line)  has 
averaged only about 1–1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is currently close to zero. This 
result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as core inflation (the solid black line) 
has also been low on average over this period. 
                                                
3   The predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which uses 
a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a stochastic 
trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data definitions). The 
estimation  procedure  for  the  VAR  is  similar  to  that  used  by  Clark  and  Terry  (2010),  which  in  turn  follows 
Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and Sbordone (2014) for related 
applications.

  Inflation costs 
In  2012  the  FOMC  adopted,  for  the  first  time,  an  explicit  longer-run  inflation  objective  of 
2 percent  as  measured  by  the  PCE  price  index.5  (Other  central  banks,  including  the 
European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent inflation target.) This 
decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that persistently deviates – up or down 
– from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of ways. Persistent high inflation induces 
households  and  firms  to  spend  time  and  effort  trying  to  minimize  their  cash  holdings  and 
forces businesses to adjust prices more frequently than would otherwise be necessary. More 
importantly,  high  inflation  also  tends  to  raise  the  after-tax  cost  of  capital,  thereby 
discouraging business investment. These adverse effects occur because capital depreciation 
allowances and other aspects of our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6  
Persistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for households that rely 
on  pensions,  annuities,  and  long-term  bonds  to  provide  a  significant  portion  of  their 
retirement income. Because the income provided by these assets is typically fixed in nominal 
terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly quickly if inflation turns out to be 
consistently  higher  than  originally  anticipated,  with  potentially  serious  consequences  for 
retirees’ standard of living as they age.7  
An  unexpected  rise  in  inflation  also  tends  to  reduce  the  real  purchasing  power  of  labor 
income  for  a  time  because  nominal  wages  and  salaries  are  generally  slow  to  adjust  to 
movements in the overall level of prices. Survey data suggest that this effect is probably the 
number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8 In the longer run, however, real 
wages  –  that  is,  wages  adjusted  for  inflation  –  appear  to  be  largely  independent  of  the 
average  rate  of  inflation  and  instead  are  primarily  determined  by  productivity,  global 
competition,  and  other  nonmonetary  factors.  In  support  of  this  view,  figure  3  shows  that 
nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long periods of time. 
Inflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that have been 
particularly  relevant  to  monetary  policymakers  in  recent  years. The most  important  cost  is 
that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat recessions. Normally, the 
FOMC  fights  economic  downturns  by  reducing  the  nominal  federal  funds  rate,  the  rate 
charged by banks to lend to each other overnight. These reductions, current and expected, 
stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term real interest rates – that is, nominal 
                                                
5  
In  contrast,  the  FOMC  has  determined  that  a  number  of  considerations  preclude  it  from  setting  a  fixed 
numerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment. As discussed in its Statement on 
Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of employment is something 
that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. 
Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate of unemployment, and other related 
aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change over time, and can only be estimated 
imprecisely. As a result, views vary about what labor market conditions would be consistent with a normal 
level of resource utilization. 
6   For  a  general  survey  of  the  costs  of  high  inflation,  see  Briault  (1995).  English  (1999)  discusses  costs 
associated  with  an  increased  need  for  cash  management.  For  a  discussion  of  costs  that  arise  through 
interactions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999). Finally, 
high  inflation  may  adversely  affect  the  economy’s  allocation  of  resources  by  increasing  the  magnitude  of 
misalignments  in  relative  prices  that  result  because  firms do  not  continually  adjust  all  of  their  prices;  for  a 
discussion  of such costs in the  context  of the  new-Keynesian  model  of  inflation,  see  Ascari  and  Sbordone 
(2014). 
7   More  broadly,  if  inflation  evolves  in  an  unpredictable  manner  over  many  years,  then  even  financially 
sophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their attendant 
costs. Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other entity that 
engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or decreases in 
inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit.

rates adjusted for inflation – and improving financial conditions more broadly. But the federal 
funds rate and other nominal interest rates cannot go much below zero, since holding cash is 
always  an  alternative  to  investing  in  securities.9  Thus,  the  lowest  the  FOMC  can  feasibly 
push the real federal funds rate is essentially the negative value of the inflation rate. As a 
result, the Federal Reserve has less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low. 
This limitation is a potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great 
Recession may require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to 
restore full employment at a satisfactory pace.10 For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation 
objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent with the 
other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11  
An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly because it 
increases the debt burdens of borrowers. Consider homeowners who take out a conventional 
fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to 2 percent and their 
nominal  incomes  will  rise  about  4  percent  per  year.  If  the  economy  were  instead  to 
experience  chronic  mild  deflation  accompanied  by  flat  or  declining  nominal  incomes,  then 
after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more difficult to cover their monthly 
mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated. Moreover, if house prices fall in line 
with  consumer  prices  rather than rising  as  expected,  then the  equity  in  their  home  will  be 
lower  than  they  had  anticipated.  This  situation,  which  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  “debt 
deflation,” would also confront all households with outstanding student loans, auto loans, or 
credit card debt, as well as businesses that had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12 Of 
course, in this situation, lenders would be receiving more real income. But the net effect on 
the economy is likely to be negative, in large part because borrowers typically have only a 
limited  ability  to  absorb  losses.  And  if  the  increased  debt-service  burdens  and  declines  in 
collateral  values  are  severe  enough  to force  borrowers  into  bankruptcy,  then  the resultant 
hardship  imposed  on  families,  small  business  owners,  and  laid-off  workers  may  be  very 
severe.13  
                                                
9   Because  of  the  inconvenience  of  storing  and  protecting  very  large  quantities  of  currency,  some  firms  are 
willing  to  pay  a  premium  to  hold  short-term  government  securities  or  bank  deposits  instead.  As  a  result, 
several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat below 
zero. 
10   For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession would 
have  required  lowering  the  real  federal  funds  rate  to  negative  10  percent  for  a  time;  by  comparison,  the 
average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009. Of course, the 
FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional downward 
pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however, those policies 
had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest rate policy. See 
Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for discussions of 
the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates have on a central bank’s ability 
to  stimulate  the  economy  during  economic  downturns.  In  addition,  see  English,  Lopez-Salido,  and  Tetlow 
(2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based analyses of the effectiveness of the 
Federal  Reserve’s  large-scale  asset  purchases  and  forward  guidance  in  mitigating  the  effects  of  the  zero 
lower bound. Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of employing large scale asset purchases, see 
Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013). 
11   For a further discussion of this point, see Mishkin (2007). 
12   See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy. 
13   Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in which 
the  labor  market  can  respond  to  adverse  shocks.  In  sectors  where  productivity  is  lagging  or  demand  is 
slowing,  declines  in  real  wages  might  be  necessary  to  avoid  even  worse  outcomes,  such  as  layoffs.  For 
various  reasons,  however,  employers  often  try  to  avoid  nominal  wage  cuts.  (Bewley  (1999)  suggests  a 
number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have on 
employee morale. Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it permits 
these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal wages and 
rising prices.) But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage reductions may no 
longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to fall on employment.

  Monetary policy actions since the financial crisis 
As  I  noted  earlier,  after  weighing  the  costs  associated  with  various  rates  of  inflation,  the 
FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational definition of its longer-
run price objective.14 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, achieving both this 
objective  and  full  employment  (the  other  leg  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s  dual  mandate)  has 
been  difficult,  as  shown  in  figure  4.  Initially,  the  unemployment  rate  (the  solid  black  line) 
soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell sharply. Moreover, after the recession officially 
ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent 
headwinds,  including  households  with  underwater  mortgages  and  high  debt  burdens, 
reduced access to credit for many potential borrowers, constrained spending by state and 
local  governments,  and  weakened  foreign  growth  prospects.  In  an  effort  to  return 
employment and inflation to levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the 
FOMC  took  a  variety  of  unprecedented  actions  to  help  lower  longer-term  interest  rates, 
including reducing the federal funds rate (the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating 
to the public that short-term interest rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, 
and  buying  large  quantities  of  longer-term  Treasury  debt  and  agency-issued  mortgage-
backed securities.15  
These actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby helping to 
bring  about  a  considerable  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  over  time.  The 
unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly above 
the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level. Although 
other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how much slack 
remains  in  the  labor  market,  on  balance  the  economy  is  no  longer  far  away  from  full 
employment. In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s objective over 
the  past  several  years,  and  over  the  past  12  months  it  has  been  essentially  zero. 
Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the 
next two or three years. I will now turn to the determinants of inflation and the factors that 
underlie this expectation. 
                                                
14   Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks should 
consider  raising  their  inflation  targets,  on  the  grounds  that  conditions  since  the  financial  crisis  have 
demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal interest 
rates than was originally estimated. Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more appropriate 
target for the FOMC. While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly underestimated 
the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in the United States 
and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not take into account 
central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to mitigate the costs 
arising  from  the  ELB  constraint.  In  addition,  it  is  not  obvious  that  a modestly  higher  target  rate  of  inflation 
would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in the special conditions that 
prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through which lower interest rates 
stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably attenuated. Beyond these tactical 
considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation objective would risk calling into question the 
FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level because it might lead people to suspect that the target 
could be changed opportunistically in the future. If so, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations 
discussed below – an increased ability of monetary policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price 
stability – might be lost. Moreover, if the purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central 
banks to deal with the severe recessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be 
to rely on more vigorous supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events. 
Finally, targeting inflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in 
the Federal Reserve Act.

analysis of the combined macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s asset purchases and guidance concerning 
the future path of the federal funds rate.

  Inflation dynamics 
Models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between changes in food 
and energy prices – which enter into total inflation – and movements in the prices of other 
goods and services – that is, core inflation. This decomposition is useful because food and 
energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often depend on factors that 
are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological or political developments 
(in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case of food prices). As a result, 
core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total inflation of where total inflation is 
headed in the medium term.16 Of course, food and energy account for a significant portion of 
household  budgets,  so  the  Federal  Reserve’s  inflation  objective  is  defined  in  terms  of  the 
overall change in consumer prices. 
What,  then,  determines  core  inflation?  Recalling  figure  1,  core  inflation  tends  to  fluctuate 
around  a  longer-term  trend  that  now  is  essentially  stable.  Let  me  first  focus  on  these 
fluctuations  before  turning  to  the  trend.  Economic  theory  suggests,  and  empirical  analysis 
confirms,  that  such  deviations  of  inflation  from  trend  depend  partly  on  the  intensity  of 
resource utilization in the economy – as approximated, for example, by the gap between the 
actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the shortfall of actual gross 
domestic  product  (GDP)  from  potential  output.  This  relationship  –  which  likely  reflects, 
among  other  things,  a  tendency  for  firms’  costs  to  rise  as  utilization  rates  increase  – 
represents an important channel through which monetary policy influences inflation over the 
medium term, although in practice the influence is modest and gradual. Movements in certain 
types of input costs, particularly changes in the price of imported goods, also can cause core 
inflation to deviate noticeably from its trend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to 
year.17  Finally,  a  nontrivial  fraction  of  the  quarter-to-quarter,  and  even  the  year-to-year, 
variability of inflation is attributable to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18  
What  about  the  determinants  of  inflation’s  longer-term  trend?  Here,  it  is  instructive  to 
compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation shown earlier in 
figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long-run inflation, as is done 
in figure 5. Theory suggests that inflation expectations – which presumably are linked to the 
central bank’s inflation goal – should play an important role in actual price setting.19 Indeed, 
the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which suggests that the estimated trend in 
inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’ long-run inflation expectations.20  
                                                
16   Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation and 
thereby better discern its medium-term direction. For example, one procedure removes the components of the 
total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the average price change, 
yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a given period, rather than 
the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate. In practice, simply using core inflation does about as 
well  in  predicting  overall  inflation  over  the  coming  year  and  beyond  as  these  alternative  procedures  (see 
Detmeister, 2011, 2012). 
17   Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the pass-
through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see Hooker, 
2002; Clark and Terry, 2010). 
18   Some  of  these  idiosyncratic  shocks  are  related  to  identifiable  factors,  such  as  changes  in  Medicare 
reimbursement  rates  or  movements  in  the  (imputed)  price  of  holding  a  checking  account.  (Both  of  these 
factors  are  included  in  the  services  component  of  the  PCE  price  index,  but  not  the  consumer  price  index 
(CPI).) However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant fraction 
represents unpredictable “noise.” 
19   Most  theoretical  versions  of  the  Phillips  curve  suggest  that  inflation  should  depend  on  short-run  inflation 
expectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data better.

inflation forecasting. Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan Surveys of

To  summarize,  this  analysis  suggests  that  economic  slack,  changes  in  imported  goods 
prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer-term trend 
that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations. As some will recognize, this 
model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is commonly referred to as an 
expectations-augmented  Phillips  curve.21  Total  inflation  in  turn  reflects  movements  in  core 
inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food and energy. 
An  important  feature  of  this  model  of  inflation  dynamics  is  that  the  overall  effect  that 
variations  in  resource  utilization,  import  prices,  and  other  factors  will  have  on  inflation 
depends  crucially  on  whether  these  influences  also  affect  long-run  inflation  expectations. 
Figure  6  illustrates  this  point  with  a  stylized  example  of  the  inflation  consequences  of  a 
gradual increase in the level of import prices – perhaps occurring in response to stronger real 
activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar – that causes the rate of change of 
import prices to be elevated for a time.22 First, consider  the situation shown in panel A, in 
which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are not solidly anchored, but instead 
adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are actually observed.23 Such conditions  
–  which  arguably  prevailed  in  the  United  States from  the  1970s to  the mid-1990s  –  could 
plausibly  arise  if  the  central  bank  has,  in  the  past,  allowed  significant  and  persistent 
movements  in  inflation  to  occur.  In  this  case,  the  temporary  rise  in  the  rate  of  change  of 
import prices results in a permanent increase in inflation. This shift occurs because the initial 
increase in inflation generated by a period of rising import prices leads households and firms 
to  revise  up  their  expectations  of  future  inflation.  A  permanent  rise  in  inflation  would  also 
result  from  a  sustained  rise  in  the  level  of  oil  prices  or  a  temporary  increase  in  resource 
utilization. 
By contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps because 
the  central  bank  has  been  successful  over  time  in  keeping  inflation  near  some  specified 
target  and  has  made  it  clear  to  the  public  that  it  intends  to  continue  to  do  so.  Then  the 
response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import prices or any 
other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B. In this case, inflation will 
deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are rising. But once they level 
out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence of other disturbances.24  
A  key  implication  of  these  two  examples  is  that  the  presence  of  well-anchored  inflation 
expectations  greatly  enhances  a  central  bank’s  ability  to  pursue  both  of  its  objectives  – 
namely, price stability and full employment. Because temporary shifts in the rate of change of 
import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on expectations, they 
have only a transitory effect on inflation. As a result, the central bank can “look through” such 
                                                                                                                                                   
Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level – as opposed to its contour – 
cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE price index. 
21   See  Tobin  (1972)  and  Friedman  (1968)  for  early  discussions  of  the  theory  underpinning  the  expectations-
augmented Phillips curve. Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of research in 
economics. In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian framework – in 
which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form of adjustment 
costs  or  explicit  nominal  contracts  –  to  model  inflation  dynamics  (see  Woodford,  2003,  chapter  3,  for  a 
textbook treatment). Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ importantly in their specifics, 
they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource utilization as drivers of inflation 
dynamics. 
22   In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization induced 
by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices. 
23   An  expectations-augmented  Phillips  curve  in  which  expectations  of  inflation  are  assumed  to  eventually 
respond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve. 
24   Qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations – including the 
FRB/US,  EDO,  and  SIGMA  models  maintained  at  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  –  in  which  the  long-term 
behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation objective.

short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy, allowing it to focus on returning 
the  economy  to  full  employment  without  placing  price  stability  at  risk.  Indeed,  the  Federal 
Reserve  has  done  just  that  in  setting  monetary  policy  over  the  past  decade  or  more. 
Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation dynamics are a key reason why the FOMC 
expects inflation to return to 2 percent over the next few years. 
On balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well anchored at 
present. Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected inflation I presented 
earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation derived as the difference 
between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-indexed ones, called TIPS. Since 
the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been quite stable; 
this stability has persisted in recent years despite a deep recession and concerns expressed 
by  some  observers  regarding  the  potential  inflationary  effects  of  unconventional  monetary 
policy. The fact that these survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the 
same  levels  that  prevailed  prior  to  the  recession  suggests  that,  once  the  economy  has 
returned to full employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its 
pre-recession average level of about 2 percent. 
This  conclusion  is  tempered  somewhat  by  recent  movements  in  longer-run  inflation 
compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’ expectations for long-run 
inflation. This measure is now noticeably lower  than in the years just prior to the financial 
crisis.25 However, movements in inflation compensation are difficult to interpret because they 
can be driven by factors that are unique to financial markets – such as movements in liquidity 
or risk premiums – as well as by changes in expected inflation.26 Indeed, empirical work that 
attempts  to  control  for  these  factors  suggests  that  the  long-run  inflation  expectations 
embedded in asset prices have in fact moved down relatively little over the past decade.27 
Nevertheless,  the  decline  in  inflation  compensation  over  the  past  year  may  indicate  that 
financial market participants now see an increased risk of very low inflation persisting. 
Although the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well anchored at 
present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted. Anchored inflation 
expectations were not won easily or quickly: Experience suggests that it takes many years of 
carefully  conducted  monetary  policy  to  alter  what  households  and  firms  perceive  to  be 
inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent failure to keep inflation under 
control – by letting it drift either too high or too low for too long – could cause expectations to 
once  again  become  unmoored.28  Given  that  inflation  has  been running  below  the  FOMC’s 
                                                
25   In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep in 
mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI. CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point higher 
than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time. 
26   Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation. Inflation 
expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation expectations derived from 
asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but need not reflect the views of 
households and firms more broadly. As an empirical matter, the little information available on the longer-term 
inflation  expectations  of  firms  from  the  Atlanta  Federal  Reserve  Business  Inflation  Expectations  survey 
suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys 
of  Consumers  than  the  expectations  of  professional  forecasters.  Similarly,  preliminary  data  from  a  New 
Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms are much more similar to those of households than 
those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and Gorodnichenko, 2015). 
27   D’Amico,  Kim,  and  Wei  (2014)  examine  a  number  of  models  that  use  TIPS  yields  to  back  out  expected 
inflation  estimates.  The  best-fitting  models  show  only  a  small  decline  in  longer-term  inflation  expectations 
since 2005. 
28   My  interpretation  of  the  historical  evidence  is  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  become  anchored  at  a 
particular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for many 
years. For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary policy that 
relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation expectations directly by

objective for several years now, such concerns reinforce the appropriateness of the Federal 
Reserve’s  current  monetary  policy,  which  remains  highly  accommodative  by  historical 
standards and is directed toward helping return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29  
Before turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook and monetary 
policy, a cautionary note is in order. The Phillips-curve approach to forecasting inflation has a 
long  history  in  economics,  and  it  has  usefully  informed  monetary  policy  decisionmaking 
around  the  globe.  But  the  theoretical  underpinnings  of  the  model  are  still  a  subject  of 
controversy among economists. Moreover, inflation sometimes moves in ways that empirical 
versions  of  the  model,  which  necessarily  are  a  simplified  version  of  a  complicated  reality, 
cannot adequately explain. For this reason, significant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve 
predictions, and the validity of forecasts from this model must be continuously evaluated in 
response to incoming data. 
Policy implications 
Assuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation expectations are in fact 
anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does the preceding description of 
inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for monetary policy? 
This framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from our 2 percent 
objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove transitory. As the 
solid black line in  figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably below our 2 percent 
objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching about 1 percentage point in 
both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1–1/2 percentage points this year. The stacked bars in 
the  figure  give  the  contributions  of  various  factors  to  these  deviations  from  2  percent, 
computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation model I just discussed.30 As the 
solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer energy prices explain about half of this 
                                                                                                                                                   
simply  announcing  that  it  will  pursue  a  different  inflation  goal  in  the  future.  Although  such  announcements 
might  potentially  persuade  some  financial  market  participants  and  professional  forecasters  to  shift  their 
expectations, other members of the public are probably much less likely to do so. Hence, actual inflation would 
probably be affected only after the central bank has had sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained 
commitment and ability to generate a new norm for the average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary 
policy  –  a  process  that  might  take  years,  based  on  U.S.  experience.  Consistent  with  my  assessment  that 
announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke and others (1999) found no evidence across a number of 
countries  that  the  initial  disinflation  which  follows  the  adoption  of  inflation  targeting  is  any  less  costly  than 
disinflations carried out under alternative monetary regimes. 
29   Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of labor 
costs. In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation; indeed, 
the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral – in which higher price inflation led workers to push for higher 
wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs accelerated – was 
often invoked  to  explain  the  inflationary  dynamics of  the  1970s.  The  wage-price  spiral no  longer seems  to 
provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process. In fact, some evidence suggests that, like inflation, 
the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a likely explanation for 
this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. (See Peneva and Rudd, 
2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.) More generally, movements in labor costs no longer 
appear  to  be  an  especially  good  guide  to  future  price  movements.  (This  development  does  not  imply  that 
wage developments carry no useful information: Because wage growth is influenced by labor market slack, 
observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of how close the economy is to full 
employment.) 
30   For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix. In the 
decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the 
contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to the 
core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending. (Note that the “other” category includes the 
effects of changes in food prices.) The estimated contribution of movements in import prices is also computed 
relative  to  core  inflation;  thus,  if  import  prices  are  rising  at  the  same  rate  as  core  inflation,  they  have  no 
estimated  effect  on  the  shortfall  of  overall  inflation  from  2  percent.  In  addition,  the  decomposition  takes 
account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization and other factors.

year’s  shortfall  and  a  sizable  portion  of  the  2013  and  2014  shortfalls  as  well.  Another 
important source of downward pressure this year has been a decline in import prices, the 
portion  with  orange  checkerboard  pattern,  which  is  largely  attributable  to  the  15  percent 
appreciation  in  the  dollar’s  exchange  value  over  the  past  year.  In  contrast,  the  restraint 
imposed by economic slack, the green dotted portion, has diminished steadily over time as 
the  economy  has  recovered  and  is  now  estimated  to  be  relatively  modest.31  Finally,  a 
similarly small portion of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other 
factors (which include changes in food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors 
are transitory and often switch sign from year to year. 
Although  an  accounting  exercise  like  this  one  is  always  imprecise  and  will  depend  on  the 
specific  model  that  is  used,  I  think  its  basic  message  –  that  the  current  near-zero  rate  of 
inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for energy and non-
energy imports – is quite plausible. If so, the 12-month change in total PCE prices is likely to 
rebound  to  1-1/2  percent  or  higher  in  2016,  barring  a  further  substantial  drop  in  crude  oil 
prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate noticeably further. 
To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years, we 
need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid economic growth 
and  further  gains  in  resource  utilization,  with  longer-term  inflation  expectations  remaining 
near their pre-recession level. Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. economy generally appear 
solid. Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000 since the start of the year and 
the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster than its productive potential. My 
colleagues  and  I,  based  on  our  most  recent  forecasts,  anticipate  that  this  pattern  will 
continue and that labor market conditions will improve further as we head into 2016. 
The labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years. Even so, 
further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we are probably 
not yet all the way back to full employment. Although the unemployment rate may now be 
close to its longer-run normal level – which most FOMC participants now estimate is around 
4.9  percent  –  this  traditional  metric  of  resource  utilization  almost  certainly  understates  the 
actual amount of slack that currently exists: On a cyclically adjusted basis, the labor force 
participation rate remains low relative to its underlying trend, and an unusually large number 
of people are working part time but would prefer full-time employment.32 Consistent with this 
assessment  is  the  slow  pace  at  which  hourly  wages  and  compensation  have  been  rising, 
which suggests that most firms still find it relatively easy to hire and retain employees. 
Reducing  slack  along  these  other  dimensions  may  involve  a  temporary  decline  in  the 
unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the longer 
run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent. For example, attracting discouraged workers back 
into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful employment opportunities and 
strong hiring. Similarly, firms may be unwilling to restructure their operations to use more full-
time workers until they  encounter greater difficulty filling part-time positions. Beyond these 
considerations, a modest decline in the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time 
would,  by  increasing  resource  utilization,  also  have  the  benefit  of  speeding  the  return  to 
2 percent inflation. Finally, albeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse 
                                                
31   As  discussed  later,  the  current  difference  between  the  unemployment  rate  and  its  normal  longer-run  level 
likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market. If so, the estimates reported in 
figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent and, 
correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors. For example, if the standard unemployment gap 
currently  understates  the  true  level  of  slack  by  1/2  percentage  point,  then  the  contribution  of  slack  to  this 
year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate reported in figure 8.

some of the significant supply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, 
thereby improving Americans’ standard of living.33 
Consistent  with  the  inflation  framework  I  have  outlined,  the  medians  of  the  projections 
provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation gradually moving back to 
2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in unemployment slightly below the median 
estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the longer run. These projections embody two key 
judgments regarding the projected relationship between real activity and interest rates. First, 
the real federal funds rate  is  currently  somewhat  below  the  level  that  would  be  consistent 
with real GDP expanding in line with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is 
likely  to  continue  to  fall  in  the  absence  of  some  tightening.  Second,  participants  implicitly 
expect that the various headwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue 
to  fade,  thereby  boosting  the  economy’s  underlying  strength.  Combined,  these  two 
judgments imply that the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full 
employment  in  the  medium  run  should  rise  gradually  over  time.  This  expectation, coupled 
with inherent lags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, 
are  the  key  reasons  that  most  of  my  colleagues  and  I  anticipate  that  it  will  likely  be 
appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to 
continue boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves 
further and inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective. 
By itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds rate should 
have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general economy. What matters 
for  overall  financial  conditions  is  the  entire  trajectory  of  short-term  interest  rates  that  is 
anticipated by markets and the public. As I noted, most of my colleagues and I anticipate that 
economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short-term interest rates at a quite gradual 
pace over the next few years. It’s important to emphasize, however, that both the timing of 
the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to our federal funds rate target will 
depend  on  how  developments  in  the  economy  influence  the  Committee’s  outlook  for 
progress toward maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
The  economic  outlook, of course,  is  highly  uncertain  and  it  is  conceivable, for example,  that 
inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the apparent anchoring of 
inflation  expectations.  Here,  Japan’s  recent  history  may  be  instructive:  As  shown  in  figure 9, 
survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in that country remained positive and stable 
even as that country experienced many years of persistent, mild deflation.34 The explanation for 
the  persistent  divergence  between  actual  and  expected  inflation  in  Japan  is  not  clear,  but  I 
believe that it illustrates a problem faced by all central banks: Economists’ understanding of the 
dynamics of inflation is far from perfect. Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of 
our models often err, sometimes significantly so. Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or 
rapidly than the Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would 
need to adjust the stance of policy in response. 
Considerable  uncertainties  also  surround  the  outlook  for  economic  activity.  For  example,  we 
cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the domestic economy 
will continue to fade. Moreover, net exports have served as a significant drag on growth over the 
past  year  and  recent  global  economic  and  financial  developments  highlight  the  risk  that  a 
slowdown  in  foreign  growth  might  restrain  U.S.  economic  activity  somewhat  further.  The 
Committee  is  monitoring  developments  abroad,  but  we  do  not  currently  anticipate  that  the 
                                                
33   For a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of partially 
reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and Wilcox (2015) 
and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming). 
34   In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit actual 
inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has substantially 
recovered.

effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to 
have a significant effect on the path for policy. That said, in response to surprises affecting the 
outlook for economic activity, as with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust 
the stance of policy so that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent 
objective over the medium term in the context of maximum employment. 
Given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask: Why not hold off raising the 
federal funds rate  until  the  economy  has  reached  full  employment  and  inflation  is  actually 
back at 2 percent? The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary policy affects real activity 
and  inflation  with  a  substantial  lag.  If  the  FOMC  were  to  delay  the  start  of  the  policy 
normalization process for too long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively 
abruptly  to  keep  the  economy  from  significantly  overshooting  both  of  our  goals.  Such  an 
abrupt  tightening  would  risk  disrupting  financial  markets  and  perhaps  even  inadvertently 
push  the  economy  into  recession.  In  addition,  continuing  to  hold  short-term  interest  rates 
near  zero  well  after  real  activity  has  returned  to  normal  and  headwinds  have  faded  could 
encourage  excessive  leverage  and  other  forms  of  inappropriate  risk-taking  that  might 
undermine  financial  stability.  For  these  reasons,  the  more  prudent  strategy  is  to  begin 
tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace, adjusting policy as needed in light of 
incoming data. 
Conclusion 
To  conclude,  let  me  emphasize  that,  following  the  dual  mandate  established  by  the 
Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum employment 
and price stability. To this end, we have maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy 
since  the  financial  crisis;  that  policy  has  fostered  a  marked  improvement  in  labor  market 
conditions and helped check undesirable disinflationary pressures. However, we have not yet 
fully attained our objectives under the dual mandate: Some slack remains in labor markets, 
and  the  effects  of  this  slack  and  the  influence  of  lower  energy  prices  and  past  dollar 
appreciation have been significant factors keeping inflation below our goal. But I expect that 
inflation  will  return  to  2 percent  over the  next few  years  as  the temporary  factors  that  are 
currently weighing on inflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong 
enough to complete the return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations 
remain  well  anchored.  Most  FOMC  participants,  including  myself,  currently  anticipate  that 
achieving these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later 
this year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter. But if the economy surprises 
us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.

  The estimated inflation model and inflation decomposition procedure 
Appendix: 
The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations – an identity 
for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and a 
simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE inflation. The identity is 
  and 
where 
 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 
and core PCE prices, respectively; 
 are annualized growth rates for prices of 
consumer  energy  goods  and  services  and  prices  of  food  and  beverages,  both  expressed 
 and 
relative  to  core  PCE  prices;  and 
consumption. The core inflation forecasting equation is 
  and 
  are  the weights  of  energy  and food  in  total 
 where 
  is  expected  long-run  inflation; 
is  approximated  using  the  unemployment  rate  less  the 
 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 
  denotes  the  level  of  resource  utilization; 
 is 
a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates obtained 
using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4. 
For  estimation  purposes, 
Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural rate, while 
is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation reported in the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 50 basis points prior to 2007 to 
put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis. (Prior to 1991:Q4, this series is based on the long-run 
inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.) The relative import price term, 
, is 
defined as the annualized growth rate of the price index for core imported goods, less the 
lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied by the share of nominal core 
imported goods in nominal GDP. 
To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the series used in 
the inflation model – for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in most cases – are 
first extended through the end of 2015. In the case of inflation, the extensions are consistent 
with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation in 2015 
that  were  reported  at  the  press  conference  following  the  September  FOMC  meeting.35 
Similarly, 
over the second half of 2015 is defined to be consistent with the median of 
FOMC  projections  for  the  2015:Q4  unemployment  rate,  less  the  CBO’s  estimates  of  the 
historical path of the long-run natural rate; the CBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the 
median of FOMC participants’ most recent projections of the normal longer-run level of the 
unemployment  rate.  For  changes  in  the  prices  of  consumer  energy  and  core  imports,  the 
2015:H2 extrapolations are based on regressions of these two series on current and lagged 
changes in, respectively, crude oil prices and exchange rates. This approach predicts that 
energy prices should decline at annual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 
2015:Q4, while core import prices should fall about 2–1/2 percent at an annual rate in both

quarters.  Food  prices  are  assumed  to  remain  flat  at  their  2015:Q2  level;  this  assumption 
ensures  that  the  combined  contribution  of  food  and  energy  prices  to  inflation  in  2015  is 
consistent with the median difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and 
core  inflation.  Finally,  nominal  spending  shares  for  food,  energy,  and  core  imports  are 
assumed to remain unchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations 
are assumed to remain constant at 2 percent. 
After computing historical 
 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, the final step 
in  the  decomposition  procedure  is  to  run  a  sequence  of  counter-factual  simulations  of  the 
model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4. One by one, each explanatory variable of the model 
is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference between actual inflation and 
its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that particular factor. Importantly, the 
simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation term in the core inflation equation is 
set equal to its simulated value in the preceding period, rather than its actual value. As a 
result,  the  decompositions  incorporate  the  effects  of  changes  in  lagged  inflation  that  are 
attributable to previous movements in the explanatory variables.
