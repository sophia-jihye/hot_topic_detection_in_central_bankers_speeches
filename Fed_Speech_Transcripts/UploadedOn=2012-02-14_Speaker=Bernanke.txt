Ben S Bernanke: Housing markets in transition Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the 2012 National Association of Homebuilders International Builders’ Show  Orlando  Florida  10 February 2012. The economic recovery began more than two years ago  but it doesn’t feel like much of a recovery for many Americans – certainly for those of you who depend on the housing sector for your living  as well as for the millions of others who have seen their home values plummet or lost their homes through foreclosure. Though some progress has been made in reversing the losses in jobs and income sustained during the recession  the pace of expansion has been frustratingly slow and the unemployment rate remains very high by historical standards. The state of the housing sector has been a key impediment to a faster recovery. In the typical economic recovery  a resurgent housing sector helps fuel reemployment and rising incomes. But as you know all too well  that scenario has not played out this time. Although the precipitous declines in construction that began in 2006 are  thankfully  now behind us  homebuilding remains depressed in most areas  relative both to where it was before the downturn and to where it will need to be to meet the needs of a growing population in the longer term. The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in the state of housing and has been actively engaged in analyzing the housing and mortgage markets.1 Issues related to the housing market and housing finance are important factors in the Federal Reserve’s various roles in formulating monetary policy  regulating banks  and protecting consumers of financial services. Traditionally  mortgage interest rates have been a key transmission channel of monetary policy; and banks’ mortgage lending policies directly affect their own safety and soundness as well as the access of creditworthy households to mortgage credit. My remarks today will focus on current housing market conditions and on how housing problems have affected borrowers  lenders  communities  and the broader economy. I’ll also discuss some specific sources of our housing problems  including tight conditions in the mortgage market and the overhang of foreclosed and vacant homes. Overview of the state of the housing market One way to understand conditions in the housing market is to focus on the balance of supply and demand. For the past few years  the actual and potential supply of single-family homes has greatly exceeded the effective demand. The elevated number of homes that are currently vacant instead of owner occupied reflects the imbalance. According to the most recent estimate  about 1-3/4 million homes are currently unoccupied and for sale. While this figure has declined slightly during the past few years  it is nonetheless up dramatically from the first half of the 2000s  when readings of about 1-1/4 million vacant homes were the norm. Of course  housing conditions vary by region  and vacancy rates in some locations are 1 These remarks draw heavily on research conducted by Federal Reserve staff  including work presented in the white paper on the U.S. housing market that was transmitted to the Congress in January (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012)  “The U.S. Housing Market: Current Conditions and Policy Considerations (PDF) ” white paper (Washington: Board of Governors  January)  http://federalreserve .gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf) and in a publication on real estate owned and vacant properties (see Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010)  REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization  of Governors  September)  www.federalreserve.gov /newsevents/conferences/reo_20100901.pdf). (Washington: Board report BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 the willingness of some households substantially higher than the national average. For example  here in Florida the homeowner vacancy rate in the third quarter of 2011 averaged 3.2 percent  compared with the national average of 2.4 percent.2 Moreover  a very large number of additional homes are poised to come on the owner- occupied market. In each of the past few years  roughly 2 million homes have entered the foreclosure process  and many of these homes have been put up for sale  crowding out much of the need for new building. Looking ahead  the relatively high rate of foreclosures is likely to continue for a while  putting additional homes on the market and dislocating families and disrupting communities in the process. At the same time  a number of factors are constraining demand. Household formation has been down  particularly among young adults. High unemployment and uncertain job prospects may have reduced to homeownership. Availability of mortgage credit is an important constraint  to which I will return later. Additionally  housing may no longer be viewed as the secure investment it once was thought to be  given uncertainty about future home prices and the economy more generally. Not surprisingly  the large imbalance of supply and demand has been reflected in a drop in home values of historic proportions. Nationally  house prices have plunged about 30 percent in nominal terms from their peak and nearly 40 percent in real  or inflation-adjusted  terms. The imbalance of supply and demand has also been reflected in the decline in home construction that I mentioned earlier. Since 2009  the pace of single-family housing starts has averaged less than 500 000 units per year. During the 15 years before the financial crisis  the pace of single-family starts had never fallen below 1 million units per year. In contrast to the situation for owner-occupied homes  rental markets around the country have strengthened somewhat. In particular  vacancy rates for rental properties have declined and now stand near the lower end of their range over the past eight years. Not surprisingly  rents have been increasing and the construction of apartment buildings has picked up. To recap  the housing sector continues to suffer from serious imbalances – a marked excess supply for owner-occupied housing accompanied by a stronger rental markets. The narrative of the housing market over the next several years will revolve around the resolution of those imbalances. to commit Broader implications of the problems in the housing market As homebuilders  you naturally pay close attention to the demand for new homes and their prices. These factors are important for the health of your industry  including its ability to create jobs in construction and related activities. But the problems in housing also have important implications outside the construction industry. For instance  consider the effects on neighborhoods and communities. Foreclosures  particularly when they are geographically concentrated  can diminish the values of nearby properties.3 Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned  as legal proceedings or 2 National and state level homeowner vacancy rates are available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/hvs/charts/index.html. 3 See  for example  John Y.

(PDF) ” Fannie Mae Foundation  Housing Policy Debate  vol. 17 2 BIS central bankers’ speeches other factors delay their resale. Deteriorating or vacant properties can  in turn  directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood  for example  by leading to increases in vandalism or crime. Moreover  the continuing price declines typical in neighborhoods with many foreclosures depress the tax base of the community. A vicious circle can get started: Increasing vacancies together with decreasing tax revenue and consequent cutbacks in services can further depress home prices  putting the goal of neighborhood stabilization even further out of reach. As I mentioned earlier  problems in the housing market have also restrained the broader economic recovery. For example  by some estimates  declines in house prices have reduced homeowners’ equity by more than 50 percent in the aggregate since the peak of the housing boom  resulting in more than a $7 trillion loss of household wealth.4 Indeed  about 12 million homeowners – more than 1 out of 5 with a mortgage – are underwater  meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. One of the effects of declines in housing wealth is to reduce the ability and willingness of households to spend. While estimates vary  homeowners are believed to spend somewhere between $3 and $5 per year less for every $100 of housing value lost.5 Based on those estimates  it appears that recent declines in housing wealth may be reducing consumer spending between $200 billion and $375 billion per year. That reduction corresponds to lower living standards for many Americans. And  importantly  lower sales of goods and services also reduce the incentives of firms to invest and hire  thereby slowing the recovery. Of course  these consumer-related effects are on top of the direct consequences of low rates of home construction for job creation and income. Low or negative equity creates additional problems for households. It reduces financial flexibility: Homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages cannot tap home equity to pay for emergency health expenses or their children’s college educations. Mobility may be affected to some degree; underwater borrowers who have difficulty selling their homes may find it more difficult to move to take new jobs. Moreover  homeowners with underwater mortgages may find it difficult or impossible to take advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages  even if they are current on their payments.6 The state of housing and mortgage markets may also be holding back the recovery of our financial system and the normalization of credit conditions. Mortgage delinquencies surged between 2007 and 2009 and remain high  imposing losses on lenders  mortgage insurers  and investors. Although some of the losses were the result of poorly underwritten mortgages  an increasing share of losses have arisen from prime mortgages that were originally fully documented with significant down payments  but that have defaulted due to the weak economy and housing market. The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have used stress tests and other tools to help ensure that banks have enough capital to cover mortgage 4 See Board of Governors  “The U.S. Housing Market ” p. 1 (see note 1). 5 See  for example  Raphael Bostic  Stuart Gabriel  and Gary Painter (2005)  “Housing Wealth  Financial Wealth  and Consumption: New Evidence from Micro Data (PDF) ” Marshall School of Business and School of Policy  Planning and Development Working Paper (Los Angeles: University of Southern California  June)  www.rst.nus.edu.sg/research/symposium_files/s.gabriel.pdf; Christopher D.

On the margin  though  some lenders might be inclined to respond to losses by tightening credit terms or being more cautious about extending loans rather than by raising additional capital.7 In short  housing problems affect the homebuilding industry  of course  but also have much broader effects – on neighborhoods and communities  on homeowners  on the financial system  and on the vitality of the economy as a whole. This observation underscores the importance of efforts to improve the condition of the housing market. Availability of mortgage credit So why has the recovery in housing been so slow? One important factor is restraints on mortgage credit. Since its peak in 2007  U.S. home mortgage credit outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real terms. In prior recoveries  mortgage credit had begun to grow four years after the business cycle peak – but not this time around.8 One reason for the very slow recovery in mortgage credit  despite monetary policy actions that have helped drive mortgage rates to historically low levels  is that many lending institutions have tightened underwriting conditions dramatically  relative to the pre-recession period.9 Given the lax standards during the credit boom  some tightening was doubtless appropriate to protect consumers and ensure lenders’ safety and soundness. However  current lending practices appear to reflect  in part  obstacles that are limiting or preventing lending even to creditworthy households. For example  mortgage originators appear to be reluctant to extend credit to some potential borrowers who could meet the underwriting standards currently set by the government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs). Indeed  fewer than half of lenders are offering mortgages to borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a down payment of 10 percent  even though such loans could be within the GSE purchase parameters.10 A number of possibilities could 7 The effect of bank capital on lending is a critical determinant of the linkage between financial conditions and real activity  and has received special attention in the recent financial crisis. Modest effects of bank capital ratio changes on lending are reported in Jose M. Berrospide and Rochelle M. Edge (2010)  “The Effects of Bank Capital on Lending: What Do We Know  and What Does It Mean?” International Journal of Central Banking  vol. 6 (December)  pp. 5–54. For an example of a macromodel where the balance sheet condition of financial institutions plays an important role in determining asset prices and economic activity  see Michael T. Kiley and Jae W. Sim (2011)  “Financial Capital and the Macroeconomy: Policy Considerations ” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2011–28 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  May)  www.federalreserve. gov/pubs/feds/2011/201128/201128abs.html.

Surveys since then have yet to provide evidence of unwinding that tightness even for prime mortgages that can be backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae  Freddie Mac  or the Federal Housing Administration. 10 FICO scores are based on information that a credit bureau (for example  Experian  TransUnion  and Equifax) keeps on an individual. The higher the score  which ranges from 300 to 850  the lower the credit risk. Credit scores are used to inform lenders when they assess an individual's credit risk. See Board of Governors  “The U.S. Housing Market ” p. 6 (see note 1). 4 BIS central bankers’ speeches explain this reluctance to lend. In some cases  borrowers cannot obtain private mortgage insurance required by the GSEs. Thus  the weakened finances of private mortgage insurers could be damping mortgage credit availability for some potential borrowers. In other cases  lenders may be concerned about high servicing costs if mortgages become delinquent. Another set of concerns relates to so-called representations and warranties  which are contractual commitments by an originator concerning the quality of the loan. These contracts were designed to protect the GSEs or other purchasers of loans  but originators appear uncertain about how they will be enforced going forward and thus have been very cautious about making loans that could be viewed as less than perfect from an underwriting perspective. Learning from our experience with securitizations over the past decade  lenders and regulators alike should look carefully at rules and practices that may unduly diminish the origination of prudently underwritten mortgages. Another reason for tight lending standards is that private-label mortgage securitizations have virtually disappeared. The difficulty of funding loans in the private-label securitization market may have discouraged lenders from originating loans to some borrowers who may be creditworthy but may not exactly fit the criteria of the GSEs or the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Potential first-time homebuyers have been disproportionately affected by the very tight conditions in mortgage markets. Lending to potential first-time homebuyers has dropped precipitously  even in parts of the country where unemployment rates and housing conditions are better than the national average. Indeed  the propensity of younger households – headed by adults aged 29 to 34 – to take out their first mortgage has been much lower recently than it was 10 years ago  a period well before the most recent run-up in home prices.11 First-time homebuyers are typically an important source of incremental housing demand  so their smaller presence in the market affects house prices and construction quite broadly.12 Moreover  the lack of demand from first-time homebuyers may prevent current homeowners from moving up to larger homes  for example  to accommodate growing families. An additional issue is the implication of tight mortgage credit conditions for monetary policy. Because some creditworthy households are finding it difficult to obtain mortgage credit or to refinance  the strong actions taken by the Federal Reserve to put downward pressure on longer-term rates and to improve financial conditions have had less effect on the housing sector and overall economic activity than they otherwise would have had. The problem of tight mortgage credit will not be solved easily or quickly. The Federal Reserve  in its supervisory capacity  continues to encourage lenders to find ways to maintain prudent lending standards while serving creditworthy borrowers. But the slow recovery of the housing market and the economy  continued uncertainty surrounding the future of the GSEs and the regulatory environment for mortgage lending  the likely continued absence of a private-label market  and more cautious attitudes by lenders are all barriers to rapid normalization of the flow of mortgage credit. Overhang of empty and foreclosed homes To date  policymakers have been focusing on refinancing creditworthy (but sometimes underwater) borrowers  on loan modifications  and on other ways to avert additional foreclosures. This work is obviously very important. But unfortunately  not all foreclosures 11 For example  consumer credit record data show that the share of 29- to 34-year-olds obtaining their first mortgage was significantly lower in the past two years (mid-2009 to mid-2011) at 9 percent than it was 10 years earlier (mid-1999 to mid-2011) at 17 percent. 12 See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (2001)  U.S. Housing Market Conditions (PDF) (Washington: HUD  November)  available at www.huduser.org/periodicals/ushmc/fall2001/index.html. BIS central bankers’ speeches 5 can be prevented. Given the weak economy and high unemployment rates  some borrowers simply do not have the wherewithal to meet monthly mortgage payments even if their loans were to be substantially modified. Therefore  we have seen increased interest in whether anything can be done to reduce the overhang of empty and foreclosed homes.13 We estimate that about one-fourth of the excess supply of vacant homes for sale in the second quarter of 2011 was owned by creditors; these homes are often referred to as real estate owned  or REO properties.14 Moreover  Federal Reserve staff estimate that distressed sales  which include both short sales and non-auction sales of foreclosed homes by REO holders  now account for 30 percent of home sales. Although it is difficult to forecast future REO flows  we estimate that an additional 1 million foreclosed properties could be added to the REO held by banks  guarantors  and servicers in each of the next few years. These inflows will continue to exert downward pressure on home prices. In contrast to the markets for owner-occupied homes  rental housing markets across the nation have recently strengthened somewhat  as I mentioned earlier. Fueled by increased demand from families who are either unable or reluctant to purchase homes  rents are up and vacancy rates for multifamily properties are down in most metropolitan areas. With home prices falling and rents rising  it could make sense in some markets to turn some of the foreclosed homes into rental properties. According to Federal Reserve staff calculations  most REO properties are in neighborhoods with median house values and incomes that are roughly similar to the medians for the metropolitan area overall.15 Moreover  these properties are not unusually far  in terms of commuting times  from where jobs are located.16 We have compared computations of the expected annual cash flows from renting properties to the discounted prices that REO property holders typically receive when selling a home. The comparison suggests that some REO holders might come out ahead by renting  rather than by selling  some of their properties. Moreover  keeping paying tenants in homes-including leasing to the former owners at market rents – may  in some cases  be the best way to maintain property values and the quality of neighborhoods. REO-to-rental programs could potentially also minimize the amount of time that a vacant property languishes in REO inventory. That is  appropriately structured programs could help some involuntary renters become owners again by giving them options to purchase the homes they are renting. REO-to-rental programs are not a “silver bullet” for the housing market  and  indeed  implementing them presents some challenges. For example  selling the properties in bulk to investors to rent out has proven difficult at times because of lack of financing  although the GSEs have just announced a pilot program to facilitate such purchases. In addition  many REO properties may not be appropriate for REO-to-rental programs  either because they are in very poor condition or because they are not part of a sufficiently large cluster of properties to allow for economies of scale in their management. 13 For a discussion of some of the tradeoffs that policymakers might take into account in considering whether to expand these efforts to reduce the overhang of empty and foreclosed homes further  see Board of Governors  “The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1). 14 The inventory of REO for sale is roughly 140 000 units above its 2004 level  while the inventory of vacant homes for sale is roughly 600 000 units above its 2004 level  per Federal Reserve staff calculations based on data from CoreLogic and the Housing Vacancy Survey. 15 More precisely  Federal Reserve staff estimate that about 75 percent of REO properties are in neighborhoods where the median house values and incomes are greater than 80 percent of the medians for the metropolitan area. 16 Data on median home values  income  and commute times are from the 2000 census  available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html. 6 BIS central bankers’ speeches Nevertheless  REO-to-rental programs appear to have some potential for success. As of early November 2011  about 60 metropolitan areas each had at least 250 REO properties for sale by the GSEs and the FHA – a scale that could be large enough to realize efficiency gains.17 Atlanta has the largest number of REO properties for sale by these institutions  with about 5 000 units. The next-largest inventories are in the metropolitan areas of Chicago; Detroit; Phoenix; Riverside  California; and Las Vegas  each of which have between 2 000 and 3 000 units. As I noted  not all REO properties are appropriate for rental  but many do appear to be physically adequate and potentially attractive to tenants. The number of properties suitable for rental is bound to increase  as the number of properties currently in the foreclosure process is more than four times the number of properties in the REO inventory. Other options can help with foreclosed houses that have low value and are in poor condition  homes that are not likely to be dealt with adequately through the private market. For example  land banks could handle some of these properties. Land banks are typically governmental entities that have the ability to purchase and sell real estate  clear titles  and accept donated properties. Properties may be rehabilitated as rental or owner-occupied housing or  in extreme cases  demolished  depending on the needs of individual markets. While land banks are a promising option  only some states have passed legislation to establish land banks  and most existing land banks lack the resources to keep pace with the number of low-value properties in the current inventory. It is  of course  critical that local governments pursuing land banking  or similar strategies  have staff members with the appropriate skills as well as adequate oversight to ensure that public funds are employed efficiently. REO-to-rental programs  land banks  and other neighborhood stabilization efforts are just a few examples of the approaches that policymakers could consider to help facilitate the adjustment of the housing market.18 To be sure  every program requires careful analysis to ensure that it is effective and meets reasonable cost-benefit tests. Experimentation with alternative approaches could help find the best way forward. Conclusion In sum  the economic recovery has been disappointing in part because U.S. housing markets remain out of balance. Many local markets have an overhang of empty and foreclosed homes  and many potentially creditworthy homebuyers cannot obtain mortgages. The weak housing market also impairs homeowners’ financial health and diminishes the quality and stability of neighborhoods and communities. For these reasons  and because the troubled housing market depresses construction activity and employment  we need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the housing sector get back on its feet. No single solution will be sufficient. But sustained efforts to address the many interlocking factors holding back the housing market will pay dividends in the long run. 17 Federal Reserve staff calculations from data on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Real- Estate Owned Properties Portal available at www.huduser.org/reo/reo.html. Recently  only around half of the properties in the REO inventories of the GSEs have been offered for sale at any given point. The other properties are leased to existing tenants under the provisions of the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act  are located in states with a redemption period after foreclosure  or are under renovation or otherwise unavailable for sale. 18 Other potential approaches include loan modification programs  principal reduction protocols  and the use of short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Such approaches are discussed in Board of Governors  “The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1). BIS central bankers’ speeches 7
