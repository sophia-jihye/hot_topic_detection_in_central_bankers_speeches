Alan Greenspan: Government-sponsored enterprises Remarks by Mr Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  to the Conference on Housing  Mortgage Finance  and the Macroeconomy  Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  Atlanta  (via satellite)  19 May 2005. Let me begin by thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and President Guynn for hosting this conference - "Housing  Mortgage Finance  and the Macroeconomy." Clearly  housing and the financing of housing purchases have been critical components of economic activity in recent years. Understanding better how the financial structure of housing transactions influences households' economic decisions is crucial both for academics and for policymakers. In the United States  few financial innovations in recent decades have had so widespread an impact as the development of the secondary home-mortgage market and the attendant diversification of funding sources for depository institutions and other mortgage originators. Critical to the success of this innovation has been the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in promoting mortgage securitization - the key to the development of secondary mortgage markets in the United States.1 Their efforts spawned the vast asset-backed securities market that  along with credit derivatives  has contributed to the transfer of credit risk from highly leveraged originators of credit - especially banks and thrifts - to less-leveraged insurance companies and pension and mutual funds  among other investors. The stated intent of the Congress is to use the housing-related government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to provide a well-established channel between housing credit and the capital markets and  through this channel  to promote homeownership  particularly among lower-income families. Although prospectuses for GSE debt are required by law to stipulate that such instruments are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government  investors worldwide have concluded that our government will not allow GSEs to default. As a consequence  market participants offer to purchase GSE debt at interest rates substantially lower than those required of comparably situated financial institutions without direct ties to government.2 Given this advantage  which private competitors have been unable to fully overcome  the housing-related GSEs have grown rapidly in recent years. Fannie and Freddie essentially dominate the market for purchasing conforming home mortgage loans.3 The strong belief of investors in the implicit government backing of the GSEs does not by itself create problems of safety and soundness for the GSEs  but it does create systemic risks for the U.S. financial system as the GSEs become very large. As I have recently testified before the Banking Committee of the U.S. Senate  systemic risks are difficult to address through the normal course of financial institution regulation alone. But in the case of the GSEs  these risks can be effectively handled by limiting their investment portfolios  which are funded by implicitly subsidized debt. The government guarantee for GSE debt inferred by investors enables Fannie and Freddie to profitably expand their portfolios of assets essentially without limit.4 Private investors have granted them a market subsidy in the form of lower borrowing rates  which staff at the Federal Reserve Board has estimated at 40 basis points in recent years. This market subsidy is a formidable advantage in our 1 Under securitization  mortgages are bundled into pools and then turned into securities that can be easily bought and sold alongside other debt securities. Combining a diversified pool of home mortgages into a single package in this way reduces the sum of the risks associated with the individual mortgages and enables the packager to sell claims against the package that pay interest rates below the average yield of the package as a whole. 2 For example  the government provides the housing-related GSEs with a line of credit from the Department of the Treasury  fiscal agency services through the Federal Reserve  exemptions from securities registration requirements  exemptions from bank regulations on security holdings  and tax exemptions. 3 Fannie and Freddie can buy a single-family home mortgage only if the principal balance is below the "conforming loan limit." For 2005  that limit for most loans is $359 650. 4 The boards of directors of Fannie and Freddie are allowed to invest in almost anything so long as there is some link  direct or indirect  to their mission of supporting conforming mortgage markets. As demonstrated by recent innovations in the home equity lending and asset-backed securities markets  much of the $9 trillion in household credit can potentially be secured by real estate and thus appears to be available to the GSEs as investments. Moreover  the GSEs have been allowed to invest in many forms of non-mortgage debt  such as corporate bonds and commercial paper  to the degree that the GSEs can argue such investments support their liquidity goals and thus indirectly support mortgage markets. BIS Review 37/2005 1 highly competitive Aaa market  where a few basis points are often competitively determinant. Unlike subsidies explicitly mandated by the Congress  the implicit subsidies to the GSEs are initiated wholly at the discretion of the GSEs. They choose when to borrow and gain the advantage of the subsidy  and because markets perceive such debt as government guaranteed  GSEs can effectively borrow without limit. Investors have provided Fannie and Freddie with a powerful vehicle for achieving profits that are virtually guaranteed through the rapid growth of their balance sheets  and the resultant scale has given them an advantage that their potential private-sector competitors cannot meet. As a result  their annual return on equity  which has often exceeded 30 percent  is far in excess of the average annual return of approximately 15 percent that has been earned by other large financial competitors holding substantially similar assets. Virtually none of the GSE excess return reflects higher yields on assets; it is almost wholly attributable to subsidized borrowing costs. In a market system  lenders and investors typically monitor and discipline the activities  including leverage  of their counterparties to assure themselves that these entities are financially sound. Because the many counterparties in GSE transactions assess risk based mainly on the GSE's perceived special relationship to the government  rather than on the underlying soundness of the institutions  regulators cannot rely on market discipline to contain systemic risk. The profit potential created by subsidized debt has been available to the GSEs for decades. However  the management of Fannie and Freddie chose to abstain from making profit-centers out of their portfolios in earlier years  and only during the mid-1990s did they begin rapidly enlarging their portfolios. At the end of 1990  for example  Fannie's and Freddie's combined portfolios amounted to $132 billion  or only 5.6 percent of the single-family home-mortgage market. Indeed  in 1989  before the rapid expansion of its portfolio  Freddie testified before the Congress that the need for safe and sound operation and the need to provide affordable mortgages to homebuyers were inconsistent with holding a substantial portfolio. As Freddie's CEO argued at that time  by financing mortgages with mortgage-backed securities sold to investors rather than with a portfolio  Freddie avoided interest rate risks and thus could keep mortgages flowing when depository institutions were suffering an interest rate squeeze.5 Moreover  Freddie's 1990 annual report stated that Freddie could provide ample liquidity to mortgage markets and make profits by financing mortgages with mortgage-backed securities sold to investors rather than by holding a mortgage portfolio. To quote  "Freddie Mac maintains a presence in the secondary market each and every day - regardless of economic conditions - by buying mortgages from lenders  pooling and packaging them into securities  and selling these securities to investors"(emphasis added). When Freddie Mac became owned by private shareholders and began to realize the potential for exploiting the risk-adjusted profit-making of a larger portfolio  the message changed. Freddie stated in its 1993 annual report that "in short  to achieve our earnings objective  we are striving to increase our total portfolio at a rate faster than residential mortgage debt growth ... [and] generate earnings growth in excess of revenue growth through focused management of credit and operating expenses." By 2003  Freddie's portfolio had grown tenfold  and Fannie and Freddie together held $1.5 trillion in assets  or 23 percent of the home-mortgage market. Today  the interest rate and prepayment risks inherent in mortgages with a low-cost refinancing option is concentrated in the large portfolios at Fannie and Freddie. These concentrations cannot be readily handled by private-market forces because there are no meaningful limits to the expansion of portfolios created with debt that the market believes to be federally guaranteed. As Fannie and Freddie increase in size relative to the counterparties to their hedging transactions  the ability of these GSEs to quickly correct a misjudgment in their complex hedging strategies becomes more difficult  especially when vast reversal transactions are required to rebalance portfolio risks. We are thus highly dependent on the risk-managers at Fannie and Freddie to do everything right. Moreover  the success of interest-rate-risk management  especially the exceptionally rapid timing required by dynamic risk adjustments  requires that the ultimate counterparties to the GSEs' transactions provide sufficient liquidity to finance an interest-rate-risk transfer that counters the risk. 5 Leland C. Brendsel  "Government-Sponsored Enterprises " Hearing before the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Committee on Ways and Means  House of Representatives  the 101st Congress  September 28  1989. 2 BIS Review 37/2005 Otherwise  large and rapid dynamic adjustments will result in sharp changes in the prices for rebalancing and hedging a mortgage portfolio. The consequence would be added to interest rate volatility. In the end  we cannot eliminate the risk inherent in mortgages with refinancing options. But we can markedly contain the accompanying risks to systemic stability by diversifying the concentration of risk away from large  highly leveraged portfolios for which misjudgments can have quick and devastating consequences. A system of diversified and less-leveraged interest-rate-risk management would be far more resilient to the inevitable mistakes and shocks of individual risk-mitigating strategies. Such diversification would thus pose much less systemic risk  largely because of lowered leverage  which in turn is the consequence of the private-market discipline imposed on commercial and investment banks  mutual funds  insurance companies  and other current or potential holders of mortgage-backed securities. Some argue correctly that  although the borrowing rates of the GSEs are subsidized  so are those of commercial banks because of deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve's discount window and payments system. But interest rates on the long-term debentures of banks exceed the rate of interest required on GSE debt  suggesting that market participants perceive banks as far less subsidized than GSEs. Banks accordingly have access to significantly less-subsidized credit than do GSEs. To be sure  banks do have access to insured deposits at low rates. But large banks find it difficult to grow using only insured deposits. Interest rates on banks' insured deposits  while usually less than those on GSE debentures  do not account for the substantial costs that banks incur to collect  and provide services for  core and small time deposits. If larger banks could rely on low-cost insured deposits as their effective marginal source of funds  why would they pay higher interest rates to holders of their debentures? The borrowing edge of the GSEs prevails even though the biggest banks must maintain at least twice the capital ratio of Fannie and Freddie and smaller banks hold even more. Moreover  with the additional capital available at banks to absorb the inevitable hedging misjudgments  reversals of fortune are likely to create less disruption to the banking system relative to the disruption possible at Fannie and Freddie. The Federal Reserve Board has been unable to find any credible purpose for the huge balance sheets built by Fannie and Freddie other than the creation of profit through the exploitation of the market- granted subsidy. Fannie's and Freddie's purchases of their own or each other's mortgage-backed securities with their market-subsidized debt do not contribute usefully to mortgage market liquidity  to the enhancement of capital markets in the United States  or to the lowering of mortgage rates for homeowners. The key activity of the GSEs - the provision of liquidity to the primary mortgage market - can be accomplished exclusively through the securitization of mortgages; GSE portfolios of mortgage-related assets cannot serve this function. Indeed  during a crisis  the GSEs' portfolios of mortgage-backed securities (MBS)  in contrast to portfolios of liquid assets such as Treasury bills or cash  cannot provide liquidity to either the primary or the secondary mortgage market. To sell mortgaged-backed securities to purchase other mortgage-backed securities clearly adds no net support to the mortgage markets. GSE portfolios could act as a source of strength to the mortgage markets only if they contained highly liquid  non-mortgage assets such as Treasury bills  which can be readily turned into cash under all possible scenarios without importantly affecting the prices of home mortgages. Indeed  only such highly liquid portfolios would be consistent with the GSEs' mission of providing primary mortgage market liquidity during a crisis  particularly during a financial crisis. Fannie and Freddie do need to hold in portfolio some mortgage-related assets to achieve their mission. In the normal course of securitization  timing differences between purchases of home mortgages and sales of MBS imply an inventory of home loans  although most such transactions are simultaneous swaps of packages of home mortgages for MBS. Moreover  there may be some affordable housing mortgages unsuitable for securitization that serve the chartered mission of the GSE. But in total  the assets required for Fannie and Freddie to achieve their mission are but a small fraction of the current level of their assets. BIS Review 37/2005 3 Thus  if the Congress legislates a mission-only need for GSE portfolio assets  a substantial liquidation of MBS over time  coupled with an equivalent redemption of GSE debt  will doubtless be required. Such liquidation would entail not solely a removal of demand but an equal removal of both supply and demand for MBS. Accordingly  the implementation of portfolio limits should pose no significant difficulties: The amassing of GSE portfolio assets is a simple grossing-up of mortgage assets  which can be initiated and reversed in quite large volumes with relative ease. The average paydown rate of the GSEs' portfolios from 1997 to 2004 was about 25 percent. Even if outright sales of MBS were required to shrink portfolios  the proceeds would presumably be employed to redeem GSE debt. In effect  a private investor whose holding of GSE debt has been redeemed receives  in exchange  either the mortgage-backed security sold by the GSE or other assets sold by those who acquire the mortgage-backed security. In either case  the grossing-up or its reversal does not affect the net demand for high-quality securities.6 The concern of some observers that large sales of MBS will be difficult to absorb runs counter to the evidence that GSE-backed MBS  being Aaa-rated securities  already trade as part of the large worldwide market for high-quality corporate debt and U.S. Treasury issues. GSE sales of MBS  matched with redemptions of debt  will be readily absorbed in the vast market without a significant change in the relative interest rate spreads of such investments. At the most  the grossing-up and liquidation of MBS and the corresponding GSE debt might conceivably affect the MBS-GSE interest rate spread at the margin. Moreover  unwinding MBS financed by GSE debt does not affect the level of home mortgage debt outstanding or of mortgage interest rates. Indeed  we have found little  if any  evidence that the spread of home-mortgage interest rates over comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries are affected at all by variations in the size of GSE portfolios.7 In fact  contrary to the expectations that MBS portfolio accumulation lowers home mortgage interest rates  the spreads apparently widened as the portfolios grew from 1995 to 2003. In any event  since the development of the MBS market  the determinants of interest rates that finance home purchase have exhibited little  if any  response to the size of GSE portfolios. The past year provides yet more evidence of this independence  with GSE portfolios not growing and mortgage spreads  as well as the spread between yields on GSE debentures and Treasury securities  declining further. Despite the turmoil at Fannie and Freddie during the past two years  home mortgage markets have functioned well. Indeed  as an indication that the yield on debt owed by GSEs is wholly a function of the yield's perceived status as government guaranteed  the credit default swaps of both Fannie and Freddie have barely budged as the disruption in the markets for GSE equities has deepened. The MBS-GSE or GSE-Treasury interest rate spreads seem to be insensitive to changes in the degree of intermediation because of the extraordinary substitutability of Aaa mortgages and their financing vehicles for high-quality corporate debt and Treasuries. The method of GSEs' intermediation may be another reason that we find so little effect of the size of the GSEs' MBS portfolio on home-mortgage interest rates. The decision by a GSE to purchase and securitize a mortgage is made independently of the decision to place the mortgage or mortgage-backed security in the GSEs own portfolio. Thus  whatever effect the GSEs have on primary home-mortgage rates appears to flow from the decision to purchase and securitize the mortgage  not from the decision of whether to put the mortgage-backed security into the GSEs' portfolios or sell the MBS in the private market.8 6 In effect  investors who purchase MBS use their own savings or the savings of others to fund the asset. But purchasers of GSE debt fund in the same manner. Thus  if Fannie securitizes and sells an MBS  it has no need to fund it. But if Fannie does fund it  the private investor  of course  does not. In effect  the same amount of the nation's saving is drawn upon whether a purchased origination is sold as MBS to investors or Fannie funds the mortgage or MBS. 7 See Wayne Passmore (2005)  "The GSE Implicit Subsidy and the Value of Government Ambiguity " Finance and Economic Discussion Series 2005-5 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  January) (forthcoming in Real Estate Economics); Wayne Passmore  Shane M.

Sherlund (2005)  "GSEs  Mortgage Rates  and Secondary Market Activities " Finance and Economic Discussion Series 2005-7 (January). 8 One issue that has been raised in the debate about the size of GSE portfolios is the following: In the event of a shrinkage of GSE debt  would the reduction of foreign holdings of GSE debt deprive the U.S. housing market of a net source of savings not otherwise available? Foreign holders whose GSE debt is redeemed will reinvest the proceeds in U.S. Treasury issues  4 BIS Review 37/2005 Some observers have suggested that the availability of fixed-rate mortgages is tied to the size of GSE portfolios. We see little empirical support for this notion. For example  we have found no evidence that fixed-rate mortgages were difficult to obtain during the early 1990s  when GSE portfolios were small. Indeed  the share of fixed-rate mortgage originations averaged slightly less than 80 percent in 1992  when GSE portfolios were small  and averaged 66 percent in 2004  when GSE portfolios were large. Clearly  these data do not support the proposition that the size of the GSEs' portfolios positively contributes to the availability or popularity of fixed-rate mortgages. It is  of course  mortgage securitization  and not GSE portfolios  that is the more likely reason for the continued market support for the popular thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage. Without a notable direct or indirect effect on primary home-mortgage rates  it is difficult to see how the GSEs' portfolios can influence homeownership. The evident de minimis to small changes in home mortgage interest rates owing to GSE mortgage market intermediation suggested by recent studies would have little effect on homeownership. Indeed  a comprehensive survey by Ron Feldman (2001) finds that a change in mortgage rates would have to be at least 200 basis points before it would have more than a trivial effect on homeownership.9 Most analysts conclude that the primary determinants of homeownership appear to be the loan-to-value  debt-to-income  and payment-to-income ratios associated with the mortgagor and the mortgage. Over the 1990s  homeownership rates in the United States increased from about 64 percent to about 67 percent. Much of this increase seems to be due to growing incomes of households  a generally lower level of interest rates  and an increased ability to extend loans to borrowers who require higher loan-to-value ratios. The generally declining level of mortgage rates that occurred in the 1990s reflects the fact that worldwide interest rates have been generally lower and that worldwide development cannot be a consequence of GSE portfolio growth. Even with smaller portfolios  Fannie and Freddie would remain formidable institutions and their profits would provide more than sufficient support for their special affordable-housing programs. GSE mortgage securitization is a profitable activity and  with its modestly subsidized guarantee  earns above-normal rates of returns. As I testified before the Congress both this year and in 2004  the GSEs need a regulator with authority on par with that of banking regulators  with a free hand to set appropriate capital standards  and with a clear and credible process sanctioned by the Congress for placing a GSE in receivership  where the conditions under which debt holders take losses are made clear. However  if legislation takes only these actions and does not limit GSE portfolios  we run the risk of solidifying investors' perceptions that the GSEs are instruments of the government and that their debt is equivalent to government debt. The GSEs will have an increased facility to continue to grow faster than the overall home-mortgage market; indeed because their portfolios are not constrained  by law  to exclusively home mortgages  GSEs can grow virtually without limit. GSE's mortgage securitization  in contrast to their portfolio holdings  is the key to maintaining and enhancing the benefits of Fannie and Freddie to homebuyers and secondary mortgage markets. And mortgage securitization  unlike the GSE portfolio holdings  does not create substantial systemic risks. Thus  one way to limit the GSE portfolios is to create a strong presumption that almost all mortgage-related assets can be securitized. The GSEs would need to establish  with their regulator  that any asset held in their portfolio could not be securitized. In other words  the method of GSE financing most consistent with their missions is to securitize assets first and to hold in their portfolios only those assets that are very difficult or unduly expensive to securitize. as GSE debt was perceived  in effect  as higher-yielding Treasury debt. Accordingly  the effect on the financing of our current account deficit would likely be nil. Moreover  there is no reason to believe that the effect on interest rates for MBS and home mortgages from reduced foreign holdings of GSE debt would be any different from the evident quite small change owing to reduced domestic holdings of GSE debt. 9 Ron J. Feldman (2001)  "Mortgage Rates  Homeownership Rates  and Government-Sponsored Enterprises " Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Annual Report  pp. 3-23. BIS Review 37/2005 5 Without the needed restrictions on the size of the GSE balance sheets  we put at risk our ability to preserve safe and sound financial markets in the United States  a key ingredient of support for housing. Financial instability coupled with the higher interest rates it creates is the most formidable barrier to the growth  if not the level  of homeownership. Huge  highly leveraged GSEs subject to significant interest rate risk are not conducive to the long-term financial stability that a nation of homeowners requires. 6 BIS Review 37/2005
