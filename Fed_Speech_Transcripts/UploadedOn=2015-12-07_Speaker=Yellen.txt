  Janet L Yellen: The economic outlook and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Ms  Janet  L  Yellen,  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System, to the Economic Club of Washington, Washington DC, 2 December 2015. 
 Thank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you today. I would 
like  to  offer  my  assessment  of  the  U.S.  economy,  nearly  six  and  half  years  after  the 
beginning  of the  current  economic  expansion,  and  my  view  of  the  economic  outlook.  I  will 
describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s 
(FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices and what the current situation and 
the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to evolve to best foster the attainment of 
those objectives. 
The economic outlook 
The  U.S.  economy  has  recovered  substantially  since 
the  Great  Recession.  The 
unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in 
October  of  this  year.  At  that  level,  the  unemployment  rate  is  near  the  median  of  FOMC 
participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1  The economy has created 
about  13  million  jobs  since  the  low  point  for  employment  in  early  2010,  and  total  nonfarm 
payrolls are now almost 4–1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession. Most recently, 
after  a  couple  months  of  relatively  modest  payroll  growth,  employers  added  an  estimated 
271,000  jobs  in  October.  This  increase  brought  the  average  monthly  gain  since  June  to 
about 195,000 – close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first half of the year and 
still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the labor market. 
Despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the labor market 
has reached full employment. Let me describe the basis for that view. 
To begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as out of the 
labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market. To be classified as 
unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought work within the 
past  four  weeks.  Most  of  those  not  seeking  work  are  appropriately  not  counted  as 
unemployed. These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in school, and those 
staying home to care for children and other dependent family members. Even in a stronger 
job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not to work. 
But some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work if the 
likelihood  of  finding  a  job  rose  or  if  the  expected  pay  was  higher.  Examples  here  include 
people  who  had  become  too  discouraged  to  search  for  work  when  the  prospects  for 
employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended. In October, 
almost  2  million  individuals  classified  as  outside  the  labor  force  because  they  had  not 
searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were available 
for work. This is a considerable number of people, and some of them undoubtedly would be 
drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to strengthen. Likewise, some 
of those who report they don’t want to work now could change their minds in a stronger job 
market. 
Another  margin  of  labor  market  slack  not  reflected  in  the  unemployment  rate  consists  of 
individuals  who  report  that  they  are  working  part  time  but  would  prefer  a  full-time  job  and 
cannot find one – those classified as “part time for economic reasons.” The share of such

FOMC meeting. See Board of Governors (2015b).

  workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great Recession to around 
6–1/2 percent by 2010. Since then, however, the share of these part time workers has fallen 
considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed. While this decline represents 
considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that over time may have increased 
the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some room remains for the hours of these 
workers to increase as the labor market improves further. 
The pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator, albeit an 
imperfect  one,  of  the  degree  of  labor  market  slack.  Until  recently  labor  compensation  had 
grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2–1/2 percent. More recently, 
however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of average hourly earnings for 
all employees and of compensation per hour in the business sector. While it is too soon to 
conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will continue, a sustained pickup would 
likely signal a diminution of labor market slack. 
Turning  to  overall  economic  activity,  U.S.  economic  output  –  as  measured  by  inflation-
adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP – has increased at a moderate pace, 
on  balance,  during  the  expansion.  Over  the  first  three  quarters  of  this  year,  real  GDP  is 
currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2–1/4 percent, close to its average 
pace over the previous five years. Many economic forecasters expect growth roughly along 
those same lines in the fourth quarter. 
Growth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted more than 
1/2  percentage  point,  on  average,  from  the  annual  rate  of  real  GDP  growth  over  the  past 
three  quarters.  Foreign  economic  growth  has  slowed,  damping  increases  in  U.S.  exports, 
and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last year, making our 
exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper. 
By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP) – which includes household 
spending,  business  fixed  investment,  and  residential  investment,  and  currently  represents 
about 85 percent of aggregate spending – has increased at an annual rate of 3 percent this 
year,  significantly  faster  than  real  GDP.  Household  spending  growth  has  been  particularly 
solid  in  2015,  with  purchases  of  new  motor  vehicles  especially  strong.  Job  growth  has 
bolstered  household  income,  and  lower  energy  prices  have  left  consumers  with  more  to 
spend on other goods and services. These same factors likely have contributed to consumer 
confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year. Increases in home values and stock 
market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt, have pushed up the net worth of 
households,  which  also  supports  consumer  spending.  Finally,  interest  rates  for  borrowers 
remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s accommodative monetary policy, and these low rates 
appear to have been especially relevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable 
goods.2  
Other  components  of  PDFP,  including  residential  and  business  investment,  have  also 
advanced this year. The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported further 
gains in the housing sector. Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending have been 
faster  so  far  in  2015  than  last  year,  although  the  level  of  new  residential  construction  still 
remains fairly low. And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where lower oil prices have 
led  to  substantial  cuts  in  outlays  for  new  structures,  business  investment  spending  has 
posted moderate gains. 
On balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and over the 
entire  expansion  has  been  sufficient  to  help  move  the  labor  market  closer  to  the  FOMC’s 
goal of maximum employment. However, less progress has been made on the second leg of 
our dual mandate – price stability – as inflation continues to run below the FOMC’s longer-

  run objective of 2 percent. Overall consumer price inflation – as measured by the change in 
the  price  index  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  –  was  only  1/4  percent  over  the 
12 months ending in October. However, this number largely reflects the sharp fall in crude oil 
prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has pushed down retail prices for gasoline and 
other  consumer  energy  products.  Because  food  and  energy  prices  are  volatile,  it  is  often 
helpful to look at inflation excluding those two categories – known as core inflation – which is 
typically a better indicator of future overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation. 
But core inflation – which ran at 1–1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October – is 
also well below our 2 percent objective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. 
The  stronger  dollar  has  pushed  down  the  prices  of  imported  goods,  placing  temporary 
downward  pressure  on  core  inflation.3  The  plunge  in  crude  oil  prices  may  also  have  had 
some small indirect effects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, 
as  producers  passed  on  to  their  customers  some  of  the  reductions  in  their  energy-related 
costs. Taking account of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 
1/4 to 1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States 
has been running in the vicinity of 1–1/2 to 1–3/4 percent. 
Let me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several years. To 
summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that will be sufficient 
to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in the remaining margins 
of  labor  market  slack,  and  a  rise  in  inflation  to  our  2  percent  objective.  I  expect  that  the 
fundamental  factors  supporting  domestic  spending  that  I  have  enumerated  today  will 
continue  to  do  so,  while  the  drag  from  some  of  the  factors  that  have  been  weighing  on 
economic  growth  should  begin  to  lessen  next  year.  Although  the  economic  outlook,  as 
always,  is  uncertain,  I  currently  see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  economic  activity  and  the 
labor market as very close to balanced. 
Turning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the higher 
foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign economies, has 
restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year. In addition, lower crude oil prices 
have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector. I anticipate that the drag on U.S. economic 
growth  from  these factors  will  diminish  in  the  next  couple  of  years  as  the  global  economy 
improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is completed. 
Although developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic growth that we 
are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late summer. Among 
emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the slowdown in the Chinese 
economy, which has received considerable attention, will  likely continue  to be modest and 
gradual.  China  has  taken  actions  to  stimulate  its  economy  this  year  and  could  do  more  if 
necessary. A number of other emerging market economies have eased monetary and fiscal 
policy  this  year,  and  economic  activity  in  these  economies  has  improved  of  late. 
Accommodative  monetary  policy  is  also  supporting  economic  growth  in  the  advanced 
economies.  A  pickup  in  demand  in  many  advanced  economies  and  a  stabilization  in 
commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth prospects of emerging market economies. 
A final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal policy. This 
year  the  effect  of  federal  fiscal  policy  on  real  GDP  growth  has  been  roughly  neutral,  in 
contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and fiscal policy actions 
to  reduce  the  federal  budget  deficit  created  significant  drags  on  growth.4  Also,  the  budget

economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth roughly  
1–1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would have been 
otherwise. See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).

  situation  for  many  state  and  local  governments  has  improved  as  the  economic  expansion 
has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing them to increase their hiring and 
spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of the Great Recession. Looking ahead, 
I  anticipate  that  total  real  government  purchases  of  goods  and  services  should  have  a 
modest positive effect on economic growth over the next few years.5  
Regarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in prices for crude 
oil  and  imports  over  the  past  year  and  a  half  will  diminish  next  year. With  less  downward 
pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure from a further tightening 
in  U.S.  labor  and  product  markets, I  expect  inflation  to move  up  to  the  FOMC’s  2  percent 
objective over the next few years. Of course, inflation expectations play an important role in 
the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to our 2 percent objective over the medium 
term  relies  on  a  judgment  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations  remain  reasonably  well 
anchored. In this regard, recent measures from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the 
Blue  Chip  Economic  Indicators,  and  the  Survey  of  Primary  Dealers  have  continued  to  be 
generally  stable.  The  measure  of  longer-term  inflation  expectations  from  the  University  of 
Michigan  Surveys  of  Consumers,  in  contrast,  has  lately  edged  below  its  typical  range  in 
recent years. However, this measure often seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, 
to large changes in actual inflation, and the very low readings on headline inflation over the 
past  year  may  help  explain  some  of the  recent decline  in  the  Michigan  measure.6  Market-
based  measures  of  inflation  compensation  have  moved  up  some  in  recent  weeks  after 
declining to historically  low levels earlier  in the fall. While the low level  of these measures 
appears to reflect, at least in part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to

Monetary policy 
Let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy. Reflecting 
progress  toward  the  Committee’s  objectives,  many  FOMC  participants  indicated  in 
September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the time, that it would 
be  appropriate to  raise the  target  range for the federal funds  rate  by  the  end  of  this  year. 
Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until later to raise the target 
funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase would depend on what the 
incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook. 
In the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its judgment 
that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate when we 
had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were reasonably confident that 
inflation  would  move  back  to  the  Committee’s  2  percent  objective  over  the  medium  term. 
That  initial  rate  increase  would  reflect  the  Committee’s  judgment,  based  on  a  range  of 
indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a pace sufficient to generate further 
labor market improvement and a return of inflation to 2 percent, even after the reduction in 
policy accommodation. As I have already noted, I currently judge that U.S. economic growth 
is likely to be sufficient over the next year or two to result in further improvement in the labor 
market.  Ongoing  gains  in  the  labor  market,  coupled  with  my  judgment  that  longer-term 
inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a

actual headline inflation for a time.

  return of inflation to 2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import 
prices wane. 
Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is uncertain, and we 
take account of both the upside and downside risks around our projections when judging the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy. In particular, recent monetary policy decisions have 
reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate near zero, we  can respond more 
readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, and employment than to downside 
shocks.  This  asymmetry  suggests  that  it  is  appropriate  to  be  more  cautious  in  raising  our 
target for the federal funds rate than would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates 
were  appreciably  above  zero.7  Reflecting  these  concerns,  we  have  maintained  our  current 
policy stance even as the labor market has improved appreciably. 
However,  we  must  also  take  into  account  the  well-documented  lags  in  the  effects  of 
monetary policy.8 Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too long, we 
would  likely  end  up  having  to  tighten  policy  relatively  abruptly  to  keep  the  economy  from 
significantly overshooting both of our goals. Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting 
financial  markets  and  perhaps  even  inadvertently  push  the  economy  into  recession. 
Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long could also encourage 
excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability. 
On  balance,  economic  and  financial  information  received  since  our  October  meeting  has 
been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor market. And, as 
I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps strengthen confidence that 
inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. That said, between 
today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive additional data that bear on the economic 
outlook. These data include a range of indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and 
economic activity. When my colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data 
and their implications for the economic outlook in making our policy decision. 
As you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal funds 
rate  after  nearly  seven  years  in  which  that  rate  has  been  at  its  effective  lower  bound. We 
have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect that decision. Of 
course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary policy will remain 
accommodative.  And  it bears  emphasizing  that what  matters for  the  economic  outlook  are 
the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds rate over time: It is those 
expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby influence spending and investment 
decisions. In this regard, the Committee anticipates that even after employment and inflation 
are  near  mandate-consistent  levels,  economic  conditions  may,  for  some  time,  warrant 
keeping  the  target  federal  funds  rate  below  levels  the  Committee  views  as  normal  in  the 
longer run. 
This  expectation  is  consistent  with  an  implicit  assessment  that  the  neutral  nominal  federal 
funds rate – defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary 
nor  contractionary  if  the  economy  were  operating  near  its  potential  –  is  currently  low  by 
historical  standards  and  is  likely  to  rise  only  gradually  over  time.  One  indication  that  the 
neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has been quite modest in 
recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve’s 
very large holdings of longer-term securities. Had the neutral rate been running closer to the 
levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial crisis, current monetary policy

8  Milton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag that is 
both long and variable” (1961, p. 447). Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag comes in part 
from  vector  autoregressions  in  which  monetary  policy  shocks  have  been  identified  under  a  variety  of 
identification assumptions. See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and Uhlig (2005).

  research  and  Federal  Reserve  staff  analysis.  Figure 1  employs 
settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid economic expansion, with inflation 
likely rising significantly above our 2 percent objective. 
Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low comes from both 
academic 
four 
macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the “natural” real rate of 
interest,  a  concept  closely  related  to  the  neutral  rate.9  The  measures  of  the  natural  rate 
shown  in  this  figure  represent  the  real  short-term  interest  rate  that  would  prevail  in  the 
absence  of  frictions  that  slow  the  adjustment  of  wages  and  prices  to  changes  in  the 
economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown to promote full 
employment.10 The shaded  blue  band represents the  range  of  the  estimates  of  the  natural 
real rate at each point in time. This analysis suggests that the natural real rate fell sharply 
with  the  onset  of  the  crisis  and  has  recovered  only  partially.  These  findings  are  broadly 
consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach and John Williams, shown in 
figure 2.11  
The  marked  decline  in  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  after  the  crisis  may  be  partially 
attributable  to  a  range  of  persistent  economic  headwinds  that  have  weighed  on  aggregate 
demand. These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and limited access 
to  credit  for  some  borrowers,  deleveraging  by  many  households  to  reduce  debt  burdens, 
contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth abroad coupled with a 
significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor force growth, and elevated 
uncertainty  about  the  economic  outlook.12  As  the  restraint  from  these  headwinds  further 
abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will gradually move higher over time. 
Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants projected that, in the long run, the nominal 
federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent, and that the actual federal funds rate would 
rise to that level fairly slowly.13  
                                                
9  Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one would 
add a measure of expected inflation. The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium 
(DSGE)  model  developed  by  the  staff  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  described  in  Kiley  (2013);  (2)  a 
DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described in Del Negro 
and  others  (2013);  (3)  a  DSGE  model  developed  by  the  staff  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  based  on 
Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve 
Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]). 
10  The concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to raise 
nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices. Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be equal to 
the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions. The recent academic 
literature  draws  on  this  notion  to  define  the  natural  rate  as  the  real  interest  rate  that  would  prevail  in  the 
absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages. In simple models, this interest rate would result 
in  stable  prices  and  full  employment;  in  some  more  complex  models,  this  interest  rate  has  been  found  to 
promote  stable  inflation  and  appropriate  economic  activity,  although  monetary  policymakers  face  important 
tradeoffs in such settings. Importantly, the natural rate varies over time. For example, it generally rises with 
expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’ desire to consume today 
rather than save. For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural rate for monetary policy, see, 
for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others (2015). By contrast, Laubach and 
Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural rate as one consistent with the economy 
operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply and demand have abated. These two 
approaches  to  the  measurement  of  the  natural  real  rate  are  different  but  have  important  similarities. 
Qualitatively,  the  two  measures  would  be  expected  to  move  together  in  response  to  shocks  to  productivity 
growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very persistent. 
11  See Laubach and Williams (2015). 
12  For  analyses  of  how  a  sudden  tightening  in  access  to  credit  can  lead  to  household  deleveraging,  pushing 
down the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015). 
13  See figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 2015 
FOMC  meeting.  See  Board  of  Governors  (2015b).  The  longer-run  normal  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate 
reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds rate 
that will prevail in the longer run. Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC participants’

  Because the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and must be 
estimated  based  on  our  imperfect  understanding  of  the  economy  and  the  available  data,  I 
would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its current level and even 
more to its likely path going forward.14 That said, we will learn more from observing economic 
developments in the period ahead. It is thereby important to emphasize that the actual path 
of monetary policy  will depend on how  incoming data affect the evolution of the economic 
outlook.  Stronger  growth  or  a  more  rapid  increase  in  inflation  than  we  currently  anticipate 
would  suggest  that  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  is  rising  more  quickly  than  expected, 
making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate more quickly as well; conversely, if the 
economy  disappoints,  the  federal  funds  rate  would  likely  rise  more  slowly.  Given  the 
persistent  shortfall  in  inflation  from  our  2  percent  objective,  the  Committee  will,  of  course, 
carefully monitor actual progress toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on 
the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. 
In closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this opportunity to speak 
about  the  economy  and  monetary  policy.  The  economy  has  come  a  long  way  toward  the 
FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. When the Committee begins 
to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a testament, also, to how far our economy 
has come in recovering from the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. In 
that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are looking forward to.

estimates  of  the  longer-run  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  declined  75  basis  points,  to  3.5  percent.  When 
revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have generally cited a lower 
assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing factor. 
14  One source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty. As shown in 
figure  1,  a  variety  of  models  that  provide  plausible  descriptions  of  the  economy  give  somewhat  different 
estimates  of  the  neutral  rate.  A  second  source  of  uncertainty  is  the  limited  sample  size  of  relevant 
macroeconomic  data:  Our  estimates  of  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  represent  inferences  about  a  moving 
target.  As  a  result,  although  the  data  provide  important  signals  about  the  neutral  rate,  our  estimates  are 
necessarily imprecise. In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of the 
neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average. Moreover, one-sided estimates 
of the neutral rate – those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time – are generally 
noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data available.
