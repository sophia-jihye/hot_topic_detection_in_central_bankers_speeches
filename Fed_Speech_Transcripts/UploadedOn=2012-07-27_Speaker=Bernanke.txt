Ben S Bernanke: Early childhood education Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the Children’s Defense Fund National Conference (via pre-recorded video)  Cincinnati  Ohio  24 July 2012. Thank you very much for the opportunity to address you today. I'm especially pleased as an economist and policymaker to discuss the importance of education to the success of our economy. At the Federal Reserve we spend a lot of time looking at economic data  such as production and employment. In doing so  we try never to forget that these seemingly sterile numbers are  in fact  reflections of the economic aspirations  opportunities  and well-being of millions of Americans. When individuals are denied opportunities to reach their maximum potential  it harms not only those individuals  of course  but also the larger economy  which depends vitally on having a skilled  productive workforce. As a result  we all have a stake in the essential work that you are doing for our children. So how can we improve the opportunities for all children and give them a chance to succeed in our ever-changing  globalized economy? As the husband of a teacher and an educator myself  as well as a parent and former school board member  I know from personal experience that  for creating opportunity and changing lives  there is no substitute for a quality education. The research shows that effective educations lead to lower rates of poverty  higher lifetime earnings  and greater satisfaction on the job and at home. And specialists in economic development have identified educational attainment as a key source of economic growth and rising incomes in many countries around the world. Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process  starting early in life is crucial. Neuroscientists observe that if the first few years of a child's life include support for healthy development in families and communities  the child is more likely to succeed in school and to contribute to society as an adult. Conversely  without support during these early years  a child is ultimately more likely to drop out of school  earn lower wages  depend on government programs  or be incarcerated.1 Consistent with this research  early childhood education programs aim to nurture healthy development from the earliest years. Programs that provide enriched experiences for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all backgrounds  but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged environments.2 Importantly  state preschool assessments have shown that early childhood education programs make children better prepared for school  a precursor of future success.3 The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature. Careful studies demonstrate that early interventions can have a positive effect on young children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood. For example  analysis of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool program at ages 3 and 1 See National Scientific Council on the Developing Child (2005)  “Excessive Stress Disrupts the Architecture of the Developing Brain ” Working Paper No. 3 (Cambridge  Mass.: Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University  Summer). 2 See Arthur Rolnick and Rob Grunewald (2011)  “The Economic Case for Targeted Preschool Programs ” in Edward Zigler  Walter S.

Steven Barnett  and Kwanghee Jung (2008)  “An Effectiveness-Based Evaluation of Five State Pre-kindergarten Programs ” Journal of Policy Analysis and Management  vol. 27 (Winter)  pp. 122–54. BIS central bankers’ speeches 1 4 were  at age 40  more economically successful – for example  more likely to own their own homes – than nonparticipants in a control group.4 In other evaluations  long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5 Economically speaking  early childhood programs are a good investment  with inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6 Very few alternative investments can promise that kind of return. Notably  a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children themselves and their families  but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority of the benefits  reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers make to the economy.7 The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for children  including the youngest. Federal Reserve Banks have published articles and convened community forums on early childhood issues. For school-age children  we sponsor financial literacy and economic education programs. For these programs  we make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-income children. Many of you in the audience today are still in school or have recently graduated. Your hard work demonstrates that you understand the value of a good education for yourself. With your efforts and the efforts of others  I hope we will one day achieve the Children's Defense Fund's goal of a level educational playing field for all children. I wish you all the best in your conference and in your work. Thank you. 4 See Lawrence J. Schweinhart  Jeanne Montie  Zongping Xiang  W. Steven Barnett  Clive R.
