Ben S Bernanke: Education and economic competitiveness Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke  Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System  at the US Chamber Education and Workforce Summit  Washington DC  24 September 2007. The original speech  which contains various links to the documents mentioned  can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website. When I travel around the country  meeting with students  business people  and others interested in the economy  I am occasionally asked for investment advice. Usually (though not always) the question is posed in jest. No one really expects me to tell them which three stocks they should buy. However  I know the answer to the question and I will share it with you today: Education is the best investment. Here at the U.S. Chamber Education and Workforce Summit  I don’t really need to convince you that  as an investment  education provides excellent returns  both for individuals and for society. As executives accustomed to making hard cost-benefit decisions  you doubtless assign a high priority to the quality of your business’s workforce because you know that a key – perhaps the key – to your success is the capabilities of the people you employ. To a significant extent  those capabilities are the product of education. Here I am speaking not just of education acquired formally in classrooms before entering the workforce but also of lifelong learning that  yes  includes the formal classroom training that might first come to mind but that also includes early childhood programs  informal mentoring on the job  and mid-career retraining  to name a few examples. And when I speak of capabilities  I mean not only the knowledge derived from education but also the values  skills  and personal traits acquired through education  which are as important as  and sometimes even more important than  the specific knowledge obtained. These include such qualities as the ability to think critically  to communicate clearly and logically  and to see a project through from start to finish. Today  I would like to offer a broad overview of education and its importance to our economy from my perspective not only as an economist but also as a one-time school board member  the spouse of a teacher  and the parent of two young adults pursuing higher education. Although the United States has long been a world leader in expanding educational opportunities  we have also long grappled with challenges  such as troubling high-school dropout rates  particularly for minority and immigrant youths  and frustratingly slow and uneven progress in raising test scores and other measures of educational achievement. If we are to make progress in meeting these challenges  we must be willing to actively debate their causes and continually experiment and innovate to find solutions. The benefits of education Education imparts significant benefits both to our society and the individuals who pursue it. Economists have long recognized that the skills of the workforce are an important source of economic growth. Moreover  as the increase over time in the returns to education and skill is likely the single greatest cause of the long-term rise in economic inequality  policies that lead to broad investments in education and training can help reduce inequality while expanding economic opportunity (Bernanke  2007). But the benefits of education are more than economic. A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that more-highly-educated individuals are happier on average  make better personal financial decisions  suffer fewer spells of unemployment  and enjoy better health. Benefiting society as a whole  educated individuals are more likely to participate in civic affairs  volunteer their time to charities  and subscribe to personal values – such as tolerance and an appreciation of cultural differences BIS Review 106/2007 1 – that are increasingly crucial for the healthy functioning of our diverse society (Glaeser  Ponzetto  and Shleifer  2006; Dee  2004). From a macroeconomic standpoint  education is important because it is so directly linked to productivity  which  in turn  is the critical determinant of the overall standard of living. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that  between 1987 and 2006  ongoing improvement in the education and experience of the U.S. workforce contributed 0.4 percentage point per year to the increase in nonfarm business labor productivity (U.S. Department of Labor  2007)  a significant amount. These estimates are however conservative in that they hold fixed other sources of productivity growth  such as the accumulation of various forms of capital and the advance of technology; but workers’ skills certainly contribute indirectly to productivity growth by affecting these other factors as well. For example  the state of technology is affected both by the creativity and knowledge of scientists and engineers engaged in formal research and development as well as by the efforts of skilled workers on the shop floor who find more efficient ways to accomplish a given task. Managers who develop a new business plan or find new ways to use evolving technologies can also be thought of as adding to the “intangible ” or knowledge-based  capital of the firm  which by some estimates is comparable in importance to physical capital such as factories and equipment (Corrado  Hulten  and Sichel  2006). For individuals  the economic returns to education are substantial as well. In 2006  the median weekly earnings of college graduates were 75 percent higher than the earnings of high-school graduates. In turn  workers with a high-school degree earned 42 percent more than those without any diploma.1 These differentials are large and have been growing; indeed  they have roughly doubled in the past twenty-five years or so. The source of the widening wage gap between the more-educated and less-educated is nothing more complicated than supply and demand. The demand for more-educated workers has been increasing rapidly  partly because the much more widespread use of computers and other sophisticated information and communication technologies in the workplace has increased the reward for technical skills. The supply of highly educated workers has also risen. At the start of the 1980s  22 percent of young adults aged 25 to 29 held a college degree or more; by last year  that fraction had moved up to 28.5 percent.2 Nevertheless  the supply of educated workers has not kept pace with demand  thus generating an increased salary premium for education. Because the wages of those at the top of the educational ladder have increased the fastest  increasing our investment in education can benefit not only individuals and society but also might narrow income gaps. Education and the challenges facing America today The educational challenges our society faces should be considered in the context of three broad trends: the retirement of the baby-boom generation  the inexorable advance of the technological frontier  and the ongoing globalization of economic activity. As the baby boomers  now ranging in age from their late 40s to early 60s  leave the workforce  their places will be taken by the smaller cohort of workers born in the mid-to-late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result  the U.S. workforce – as a matter of simple arithmetic – will increase more slowly and is likely to become less experienced on average (Jorgenson and others  2007; Aaronson and Sullivan  2002). In a broader sense  the ratio of working people to retirees will decline  meaning that those still working will  in effect  be supporting relatively more non-working people. This year  there are about five working-age people (20- 1 The data are weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers aged twenty-five and older and are derived from the Current Population Survey  published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2 The data are derived from the Current Population Survey  published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2 BIS Review 106/2007 64) for every person aged 65 and older; by 2030  the ratio will be about 3-to-1 (Bernanke  2006). The slower expansion of the labor force  all else equal  implies slower growth of potential output. More schooling for more of the workforce could help cushion the impact of this demographic transition on economic growth by boosting productivity growth. Continuing advances in technology also put a premium on education. Which jobs will be most affected by technology is difficult to predict  although some research suggests that sectors that now use information technology (IT) relatively less intensively  such as health- care and other service sectors  are likely to step up their use of software and IT services (Mann  2003). Regardless  better-educated workers are likely better prepared to adapt to new technologies as they develop (Doms  Dunne  and Troske  1997). Ongoing globalization of economic activity will also lead to continuing changes in the structure of the U.S. economy – including the composition of our output of both goods and services  and thus the structure of our labor force. The world economy is benefiting from the expansion of trade and the rising productivity of countries abroad that are making great strides expanding both their infrastructure and the educational attainment of their workforces. That can be good for them  and for us. Importantly  our ability to reap the benefits of globalization will depend on the flexibility of our labor force to adapt to changes in job opportunities  in part by investing in the education and training necessary to meet the new demands (Bernanke  2004). Educational attainment and achievement: where do we stand? The United States has a long tradition of recognizing the significant social and economic benefits of providing high-quality education for as many of its citizens as possible. The United States led the world  first  in expanding access to high-school education and  then  in the post-World War II era  access to college (Goldin  2001; Goldin and Katz  1999). By 1966  about half of the workforce aged 25 and older had completed high school and about 10 percent had completed college. By 2006  more than 90 percent of adults in the labor force had a high-school education and more than 20 percent held at least a bachelor’s degree. However  most of the progress over the past forty years occurred in the 1970s and early 1980s. Since then  for example  the high-school graduation rate for 25-to-29-year-olds has not increased  and the college completion rate has risen only modestly (U.S. Department of Education  2007b). One trend is particularly disappointing: Both high-school and college completion rates for minorities continue to lag.3 Over the past ten years  the high-school completion rate for whites aged 25 to 29 hovered above 93 percent  while the rate for blacks of the same age stayed near 87 percent; the rate for Hispanics  though trending up over the period  was only 63 percent last year. The gaps in college completion are wider. In recent years  more than one-third of whites aged 25 to 29 had at least a bachelor’s degree  compared with less than one-fifth of same-aged blacks and around 10 percent of Hispanics. Assessing where we stand in terms of educational achievement (how much students learn) is fraught with considerably greater difficulties than assessing attainment (how far students progress in their schooling). And  the results of various metrics highlight both discouraging and encouraging elements. The Department of Education’s National Assessment of Educational Progress shows the average reading levels of our high-school seniors have stagnated in recent years; however  our fourth graders continue to improve in reading  and both fourth and eighth graders have improved in math (U.S. Department of Education  National Center for Education Statistics  2007b). At the same time  some initial results from 3 The data are derived from the Current Population Survey  March and Annual Social and Economic Supplement  1971-2006  published by the U.S. Department of Commerce. BIS Review 106/2007 3 the adoption of state accountability standards suggest that they have had a positive effect on students’ test-score gains (Jacob  2005; Hanushek and Raymond  2004). International comparisons of student achievement are even more difficult and present a mixed picture.4 Compared with students around the world  U.S. students still perform relatively well in reading and  in the lower grades  at math and science. Older U.S. students  however  show less ability to apply math and science skills than their peers in other industrialized countries. Lifelong learning can help us meet economic challenges In the past  the U.S. education system has responded to the needs of a changing economy  and I believe that as we address such challenges as the retirement of the baby-boom generation  advancing technology  and globalization  our education system will again make an important contribution to the adjustment process. That means  of course  that we will have to grapple with difficult issues – how to boost educational attainment  particularly for minorities and immigrant youths; how to make more consistent and noticeable progress in raising academic achievement; and how to ensure that older workers have meaningful opportunities to refresh their skills. What can be done so that our educational system will continue to play a significant role in supporting economic change? In broad terms  we must begin by recognizing that learning is a lifelong process and that we have opportunities to improve education at every point along the way. Many of these opportunities lie outside the traditional route of a kindergarten- through-twelfth-grade education followed by four years of college. I’d like to comment briefly on what economists have found about the benefits of educational investments at different points in the life cycle. Early childhood education Building the foundation for lifelong learning from the earliest ages is crucial (Heckman  Stixrud  and Urzua  2006). Research suggests that the home environment is especially important and that children who start behind find catching up increasingly difficult (Heckman and Masterov  2007). Thus  the payoff from high-quality pre-school and home visitation programs is likely very high  especially for children born into poor or otherwise disadvantaged families. Recent research – some sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in collaboration with the University of Minnesota – has documented high returns from early childhood programs in terms of subsequent educational attainment and in lower rates of social problems  such as crime  teenage pregnancy  and welfare dependency (Burr and Grunewald  2006).5 But early childhood education is only the beginning. Positive results from programs such as Head Start dissipate without further high-quality schooling at the elementary and secondary levels (Garces  Thomas  and Currie  2002). Elementary and secondary schooling Deciding what and how to teach students from kindergarten through high school and then evaluating our schools’ effectiveness in preparing students for the workforce and a lifetime of 4 The results of two prominent international assessments – The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study  conducted under the aegis of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement  and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Program for International Student Assessment – are summarized in the 2006 Digest of Education Statistics published by the U.S. Department of Education (2007a). http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d06/ch_6.asp 5 More information on the Early Childhood Research Collaborative and copies of its research papers can be obtained from the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  www.earlychildhoodrc.org. 4 BIS Review 106/2007 learning is a daunting task. I will make only a few observations on the goals we should keep in mind as we explore ways to improve learning at the elementary and secondary levels. First  we should encourage experimentation and innovation. By my reading  the research on K-12 education has  to date  yielded no easy answers to the questions of how to raise academic achievement and how to ensure that students finish high school well prepared to move on to more advanced study. A wide range of approaches has been and is being explored: smaller class size  school choice  charter school programs  accountability standards  flexibility in teacher certification rules  better teacher pay  merit-based pay  year- round schooling – the list is long and probably will get longer. The size and diversity of our country  together with the fact that state and local policymakers retain significant discretion over how to structure their educational systems  provides us a natural laboratory for assessing the effectiveness of alternative educational strategies. I view the debate about what works and what doesn’t to be a crucial part of discovering cost-effective ways to improve our educational system. The business community has an obvious interest in how well our schools prepare students for a future in the workforce and should actively participate in the debate. But we all have a stake. Students at the elementary and secondary levels are being prepared not just for work but for life. Such skills and acquired traits as critical and creative thinking  social ability  persistence  and satisfaction in accomplishment make not only good employees but good citizens as well. Exposure to the arts and culture and experience in serving the community can help support the development of these broader  harder-to-measure skills  alongside more readily measurable cognitive accomplishments in reading  math  and science. Second  teacher quality is critical. Studies show that student performance depends on putting high-quality teachers in the classroom and retaining them as long as possible (Aaronson  Barrow  and Sander  2007; Rivkin  Hanushek  and Kain  2005; Rockoff  2004). Indeed  many initiatives focus on linking students  especially disadvantaged students  with high-quality schools staffed by high-quality teachers. High-quality teachers instill in their young students a desire to stay in school and seek more education later in life  and the evidence suggests that the quality of teaching might have the biggest impact on lower-ability students (Murnane and Steele  2007; Clotfelter and others  2006; Hanushek  Kain  and Rivkin  2004). Unfortunately  our most disadvantaged communities  the ones most troubled by high dropout rates  have difficulty attracting and keeping qualified teachers. We must instill a desire among students to stay in school and to seek more education and training over their working lives. Our elementary and secondary schools must provide students a strong foundation for a life of learning. Although a wide range of remedial education programs exist  research suggests that they are more costly and less effective than a solid  sustained course of study through high school. In particular  government training programs for disadvantaged youth have a rather disappointing reputation  particularly those that are less intensive and not well tied to labor market needs (Martin and Grubb  2001; Heckman  LaLonde  and Smith  1999). A number of possibilities for improving the education of disadvantaged students seem worth exploring. For example  several experiments suggest that smaller schools and smaller classes may help disadvantaged students (although the benefits of such programs for the general student population remain controversial). Supplemental education  including after- school and mentoring programs such as Big Brothers Big Sisters  have been shown to boost school attendance (Grossman and Tierney  1998). Increasing school time – either through longer school hours or summer school – also has found some support (Jacob and Lefgren  2004). Higher education In many ways  higher education represents the strongest part of the U.S. educational system  as demonstrated by the fact that students from all parts of the world come here to BIS Review 106/2007 5 study. Our institutions of higher learning are extraordinarily varied  ranging from large public research universities to small liberal arts colleges to community colleges and vocational schools. The main business of our institutions of higher education is  of course  undergraduate teaching. But unlike some countries  we do not separate research and undergraduate education; our advanced  graduate-level research programs are housed in universities with strong undergraduate programs. Thus  our colleges and universities are important sources of research and development (National Science Foundation  2007; Litan  Mitchell  and Reedy  forthcoming). More than half our basic research – the foundation for breakthroughs that create new industries – is conducted at universities. Additionally  higher education has embraced the broader mission of translating research into new products and enterprises; our colleges and universities account for 15 percent of applied research and development (National Science Foundation  2007). The innovations that begin on campuses are diffused to businesses through patents  start-up companies  and consulting arrangements between faculty and industry. One great challenge in higher education lies in making sure our high-school graduates are prepared for it and have access to it. With college enrollment rates having leveled off in recent years  much debate surrounds how we can move more students into higher education and keep them in school until they graduate. Researchers have demonstrated a strong relationship between family income and college attendance. Since 1990  nearly 80 percent of high-school completers from high-income families (the top 20 percent of income) have enrolled in college the next fall. The proportion of those from low-income families who enroll in college the following fall has been moving up gradually  but it remains much lower – just over 50 percent.6 This discrepancy holds even for students classified as high achievers: A longitudinal study of eighth graders in 1988 found that only 29 percent of those scoring in the top fourth of the group in math – but who were from families with low social and economic status – had completed a bachelor’s degree or more by 2000  while three-fourths of those from families with high social and economic status finished their undergraduate degrees (Fox  Connelly  and Snyder  2005).7 Surely  high tuition must be one barrier to attending and completing college (Card  2001; Kane  1994)  but it is not the only barrier (Dynarski  2005). Low-income students  in particular  are more likely to come from school and family environments that do a poor job of preparing them for a successful transition to college (Carneiro and Heckman  2003). This suggests that supplemental programs to help under- prepared college students could improve eventual college completion rates; unfortunately  the research on the benefits of such programs is mixed  which reinforces the need to improve educational achievement in regular high school classes (Bettinger and Long  2005; Angrist  Lang  and Oreopoulos  2006). Community colleges have made a significant contribution to expanding educational opportunities. Offering lower costs and more-flexible schedules  they now enroll almost one- half of U.S. undergraduates. Attendance at one of these institutions is associated with higher wages  even if a degree is not completed. Evidence suggests that each year of credit at a community college is worth almost as much  in terms of increased earnings potential  as a year at a four-year college. The average student who entered  but did not complete  community college earns 9 percent to 13 percent more than the average for students who 6 These data are derived from the annual October Supplement to the Current Population Survey. They are the U.S. Department of Education’s Condition of Education 2007 available at summarized http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2007/section3/indicator 25.asp#info. in 7 Socioeconomic status was measured by a composite score on parental education and occupations and family income. The study also found that the proportion of low-scoring math students from high socioeconomic families who completed at least a bachelor’s degree was 30 percent versus only 3 percent for those from lower socioeconomic families. For those in the middle quintiles of both scores and family characteristics  the proportion was 21 percent. 6 BIS Review 106/2007 ended their education with high school. Those who completed a two-year associate degree earn an even larger premium  15 percent to 27 percent (Kane and Rouse  1999). And the earnings of graduates who started at two-year schools and transferred to four-year programs ultimately match those who begin their post-high-school education at four-year institutions (Gill and Leigh  2003). Community colleges play a constructive role not only for 18-to-22- year-olds but also for older adults  providing flexible programs for obtaining new skills  specialized training contracted for by individual businesses  remedial education  and adult enrichment. Adult education Today we are increasingly recognizing that education need not  indeed should not  stop at the age of 22. Economists have long argued that on-the-job training and learning-by-doing are significant components of the acquisition of human capital. Research shows that the knowledge and experience gained over time through informal and formal learning on the job appear to pay off for workers and accrues particularly rapidly early in their careers (Altonji and Williams  2005; Topel  1991). An extensive survey of firm-sponsored training a number of years ago found that 84 percent of employees received some kind of formal training while working for their current employer  and 96 percent received some type of informal training (Bureau of Labor Statistics  1996). With the advance of technology and the need to attract and retain skilled workers  I am certain that business-sponsored training will remain an important component of the management toolkit. Upgrading skills through continuing education and training outside the job is also important  particularly in an environment in which workers can face displacement from international competition or technological advance. Recognizing this possibility  many workers continue to acquire formal education later in life than was once traditional. For example  almost one-fifth of students at post-secondary institutions of all types are at least 35 years old (National Center for Education Statistics  2007a). And  for older workers looking to retool their skills  classroom instruction has been shown to be effective. For example  classroom training for displaced workers is estimated to boost future wages as much as for students of the usual school age  although the overall return on investment for displaced workers is lower because they have fewer remaining working years than do new entrants to the labor force (Jacobsen  LaLonde  Sullivan  2005). Similarly  studies of a number of welfare-to-work programs have reported long-term gains for those who participated in intensive basic education and vocational training (Dyke and others  2006; Hotz  Imbens  Klerman  2006). Such results suggest that well-designed programs to assist workers who lose their jobs can contribute to cushioning the effects of globalization and technological change. Conclusion Let me close by reiterating that education – lifelong education for everyone  from toddlers to workers well advanced in their careers – is indeed an excellent investment for individuals and society as a whole. Education fundamentally supports advances in productivity  upon which our ability to generate continuing improvement in our standard of living depends. If we are to successfully navigate such challenges as the retirement of the baby-boom generation  advancing technology  and increasing globalization  we must work diligently to maintain the quality of our educational system where it is strong and strive to improve it where it is not. In particular  we must find ways to move more of our students  especially minorities and students from disadvantaged backgrounds  into educational opportunities after high school. To do that  we must continually experiment  innovate  and evaluate so that we can make rational decisions about what works and what doesn’t in education. Because the quality of your workforces is so vital to the success of your businesses  you as business executives must participate fully in this process  along with other stakeholders – students  parents  BIS Review 106/2007 7 teachers  and policymakers. I’m encouraged that you are devoting so much energy and thought to this topic at this three-day conference.
