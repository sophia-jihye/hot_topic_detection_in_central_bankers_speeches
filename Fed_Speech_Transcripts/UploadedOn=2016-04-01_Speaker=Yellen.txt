  Janet L Yellen: The outlook, uncertainty and monetary policy 
Speech  by  Ms  Janet  L  Yellen,  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  Federal  Reserve 
System, at the Economic Club of New York, New York City, 29 March 2016. 
 For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of the nation’s 
leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues. It is an honor to appear 
before you today to speak about the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of maximum employment and 
price stability. 
In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the 
federal  funds  rate,  the  Federal  Reserve’s  main  policy  rate,  by  1/4  percentage  point.  This 
small step marked the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during which the federal 
funds  rate  was  held  near  zero  to  support  the  recovery  from  the  worst  financial  crisis  and 
recession since the Great Depression. The Committee’s action recognized the considerable 
progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the jobs and incomes of millions of 
Americans  hurt  by  this  downturn.  It  also  reflected  an  expectation  that  the  economy  would 
continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, would move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent 
objective  as  the  transitory  influences  of  lower  oil  prices  and  a  stronger  dollar  gradually 
dissipate and as the labor market improves further. In light of this expectation, the Committee 
stated  in  December,  and  reiterated  at  the  two  subsequent  meetings,  that  it  “expects  that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate.”1 
In my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, emphasizing that this 
guidance  should  be  understood  as  a  forecast  for  the  trajectory  of  policy  rates  that  the 
Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its objectives, conditional on 
the outlook for real economic activity and inflation. Importantly, this forecast is not a plan set 
in  stone  that  will  be  carried  out  regardless  of  economic  developments.  Instead,  monetary 
policy will, as always, respond to the economy’s twists and turns so as to promote, as best 
as  we  can  in  an  uncertain  economic  environment,  the  employment  and  inflation  goals 
assigned to us by the Congress. 
The proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light of global 
economic  and  financial  developments  since  December,  which  at  times  have  included 
significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values. So far, these developments 
have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline – or most likely – outlook for economic 
activity and inflation over the medium term. Specifically, we continue to expect further labor 
market improvement and a return of inflation to our 2 percent objective over the next two or 
three  years,  consistent  with  data  over  recent  months.  But  this  is  not  to  say  that  global 
developments  since  the  turn  of  the  year  have  been  inconsequential.  In  part,  the  baseline 
outlook for real activity and inflation is little changed because investors responded to those 
developments  by  marking  down  their  expectations  for  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds 
rate,  thereby  putting  downward  pressure  on  longer-term  interest  rates  and  cushioning  the 
adverse effects on economic activity. In addition, global developments have  increased the 
risks associated with that outlook. In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to 
leave the stance of policy unchanged in both January and March.

I will next describe the Committee’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that cloud that 
outlook,  emphasizing  the  FOMC’s  commitment  to  adjust  monetary  policy  as  needed  to 
achieve our employment and inflation objectives. 
Recent developments and the baseline outlook 
Readings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat mixed. On 
the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable. The labor market has added an 
average  of  almost  230,000  jobs  a  month  over  the  past  three  months.  In  addition,  the 
unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the workforce as the 
prospects  for  finding  jobs  have  improved,  and  the  employment-to-population  ratio  has 
increased by almost 1/2 percentage point. Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a 
moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved household balance sheets, and the 
ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines in oil prices over the past few years. 
The  housing  market  continues  its  gradual  recovery,  and  fiscal  policy  at  all  levels  of 
government is now modestly boosting economic activity after exerting a considerable drag in 
recent years. 
On  the  other  hand,  manufacturing  and  net  exports  have  continued  to  be  hard  hit  by  slow 
global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014. These same global 
developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms’ expected sales, 
thereby  reducing  their  demand  for  capital  goods;  partly  as  a  result,  recent  indicators  of 
capital  spending  and  business  sentiment  have  been  lackluster.  In  addition,  business 
investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014, which is driving 
an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity. Low oil prices have also resulted in large-scale 
layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and employment in industries 
that support energy production. 
On balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this year, in 
part  because  domestic household  spending  has  been  sufficiently  strong  to  offset the  drag 
coming from abroad. Looking forward however, we have to take into account the potential 
fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have been marked by 
bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year. For a time, equity prices were down sharply, oil 
traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were depreciating against the dollar. 
Although prices in these markets have since largely returned to where they stood at the start 
of the year, in other respects economic and financial conditions remain less favorable than 
they did back at the time of the December FOMC meeting. In particular, foreign economic 
growth  now  seems  likely  to  be  weaker  this  year  than  previously  expected,  and  earnings 
expectations have declined. By themselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. 
economic activity. But those effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions 
to market expectations for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on 
longer-term interest rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending. For 
these reasons, I anticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market 
developments since the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment 
is subject to considerable uncertainty. 
All  told,  the  Committee  continues  to  expect  moderate  economic  growth  over  the  medium 
term  accompanied  by  further  labor  market  improvement.  Consistent  with  this  assessment, 
the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation 
made  by  all  of  the  FOMC  participants  for  our  March  meeting  are  little  changed  from 
December.2  A  key  factor  underlying  such  modest  revisions  is  a  judgment  that  monetary 
                                                
2   Specifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage point 
and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the longer run 
were  unrevised.  The  median  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  in  late  2016  was  unrevised,  while  the 
projections  for  late  2017,  late  2018,  and  the  longer  run  were  revised  down  slightly.  Finally,  although  the 
2 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  
 
policy  remains  accommodative  and  will  be  adjusted  at  an  appropriately  gradual  pace  to 
achieve and maintain our dual objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
Reflecting global economic and financial developments since December, however, the pace 
of  rate  increases  is  now  expected  to  be  somewhat  slower.  For  example,  the  median  of 
FOMC participants’ projections for the federal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end 
of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end of 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December 
medians. 
As has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates needed to 
keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in recent years. 
Although  estimates  vary  both  quantitatively  and  conceptually,  the  evidence  on  balance 
indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real rate – that is, the level of the real federal funds 
rate  that  would  be  neither  expansionary  nor  contractionary  if  the  economy  was  operating 
near its potential – is likely now close to zero.3 However, the current real federal funds rate is 
even  lower,  at  roughly  minus  1-1/4  percentage  point,  when  measured using  the  12-month 
change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which excludes 
food and energy. Thus, the current stance of monetary policy appears to be consistent with 
actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential growth and further improvements in the 
labor market.4  
Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a lessening 
of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which include weak 
foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has not kept up with 
population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and productivity growth 
that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the end of the recession. 
If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal funds rate will also rise, in 
which case it will, all else equal, be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate 
more  or  less  in  tandem  to  achieve  our  dual  objectives.  Otherwise,  monetary  policy  would 
eventually become overly accommodative as the economy strengthened.5  
Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key reason for 
the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time will likely 
                                                                                                                                                   
median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage point, median projections for 
subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were almost unrevised for 
all years. For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be released with the March 
2016 FOMC minutes, see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm. 
3   The neutral rate is not directly observable. However, we intuitively know that it must have run well below its 
historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much more rapid 
pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero. As discussed in my December 2, 2015, speech to the 
Economic Club of Washington (Yellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition. I showed that model-
based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short-term interest rate that 
would  prevail  in  the  absence  of  frictions  that  slow  the  adjustment  of  wages  and  prices  to  changes  in  the 
economy,  are  currently  close  to  zero  in  four  macroeconomic  models  used  by  Federal  Reserve  staff.  Time 
series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the neutral rate definition used 
in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes (2015), are near historical lows. 
See  also  Johannsen  and  Mertens  (2016)  for  empirical  evidence  of  a  decline  in  the  longer-run  level  of  the 
natural rate, along with measures of the uncertainty attached to estimates of its current value. 
4   Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about 125 basis 
points,  simulations  of  the  FRB/US  model  under  vector-autoregression-based  expectations  suggest  that 
maintaining  this  interest  rate  gap  for  the  next  couple  of  years  would  lower  the  unemployment  rate 
½ percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed. Under 
rational expectations, the predicted effect would be smaller. For further information, see Brayton, Laubach, 
and Reifschneider (2014). 
5   Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be closed in 
order to stabilize inflation at 2 percent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy growing in 
line with its potential rate.

be appropriate. That said, this assessment is only a forecast. The future path of the federal 
funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and inflation will likely evolve in 
unexpected  ways. For example, no one can be certain about the pace at which economic 
headwinds will fade. More generally, the economy will inevitably be buffeted by shocks that 
cannot be foreseen. What is certain, however, is that the Committee will respond to changes 
in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual mandate. 
Turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed. In December, the FOMC 
anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag from lower prices 
for  energy  and  imports.  But  as  those  transitory  effects  faded,  the  Committee  expected 
inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided the labor market improves 
further and inflation expectations are stable. This assessment still seems to me to be broadly 
correct. PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February relative to a year earlier, held down 
by earlier declines in the price of oil. In contrast, core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile 
food  and  energy  components,  was  up  1.7  percent  in  February  on  a  12  month  basis, 
somewhat  more  than  my  expectation  in  December.  But  it  is  too  early  to  tell  if  this  recent 
faster pace will prove durable. Even when measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can 
vary substantially from quarter to quarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to 
weigh on consumer prices in the coming months. For these reasons, I continue to expect that 
overall PCE inflation for 2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move 
back to 2 percent over the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy 
prices  or  the  dollar.  This  projection,  however,  depends  critically  on  expectations for future 
inflation remaining reasonably well anchored. It is still my judgment that inflation expectations 
are well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some indicators of 
expected inflation do concern me. 
Risks to the outlook for real economic activity 
Although  the  baseline  outlook  has  changed  little  on  balance  since  December,  global 
developments  pose  ongoing  risks. These  risks appear  to  have  contributed  to  the financial 
market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months. 
One  concern  pertains  to  the  pace  of  global  growth,  which  is  importantly  influenced  by 
developments in China. There is a consensus that China’s economy will slow in the coming 
years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and from exports toward 
domestic sources of growth. There is much uncertainty, however, about how smoothly this 
transition  will  proceed  and  about  the  policy  framework  in  place  to  manage  any  financial 
disruptions  that  might  accompany  it.  These  uncertainties  were  heightened  by  market 
confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy. 
A  second  concern  relates  to  the  prospects  for  commodity  prices,  particularly  oil.  For  the 
United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic activity over the 
next few years because we are still a major oil importer. But the apparent negative reaction 
of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part reflect market concern that the 
price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some countries and energy firms. In the 
case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result might be a sharp cutback in government 
spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail significant financial strains and increased 
layoffs.  In  the  event  oil  prices  were  to  fall  again,  either  development  could  have  adverse 
spillover effects to the rest of the global economy. 
If  such  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  were  to  materialize,  they  would  likely  slow  U.S. 
economic  activity,  at  least  to  some  extent,  both  directly  and  through  financial  market 
channels  as  investors  respond  by  demanding  higher  returns  to  hold  risky  assets,  causing 
financial  conditions  to  tighten.  But  at  the  same  time,  we  should  not  ignore  the  welcome 
possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now expect. 
The  improvement  in  the  labor  market  in  2014  and  2015  was  considerably  faster  than 
expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience could be 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
  
 
repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more quickly than 
anticipated. For these reasons, the FOMC must watch carefully for signs that the economy 
may be evolving in unexpected ways, good or bad. 
Risks to the inflation outlook 
The inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of the year, in 
part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth. To the extent that recent 
financial  market  turbulence  signals  an  increased  chance  of  a  further  slowing  of  growth 
abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising again. And if foreign 
developments were to adversely affect the U.S. economy by more than I expect, then the 
pace  of  labor  market  improvement  would  probably  be  slower,  which  would  also  tend  to 
restrain growth in both wages and prices. But even if such developments were to occur, they 
would,  in  my  view,  only  delay  the  return  of  inflation  to  2  percent,  provided  that  inflation 
expectations remain anchored. 
Unfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted. 
During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal Reserve allowed 
actual  inflation  to  ratchet  up  persistently  in  response  to  economic  disruptions  –  a 
development  that  made  it  more  difficult  to  stabilize  both  inflation  and  employment.  With 
considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in bringing inflation back down 
to  a  low  and  stable  level  over  the  course  of  the  1980s  and  early  1990s.  Since  this  time, 
measures  of  longer-run  inflation  expectations  derived  from  both  surveys  and  financial 
markets  have  been  remarkably  stable,  making  it  easier  to  keep  actual  inflation  relatively 
close  to  2  percent  despite  large  movements  in  oil  prices  and  pronounced  swings  in  the 
unemployment rate. 
Lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have drifted down. 
Market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen markedly over the 
past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly from their all-time lows. 
Similarly,  the  measure  of  longer-run  inflation  expectations  reported  in  the  University  of 
Michigan Survey of Consumers has drifted down somewhat over the past few years and now 
stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it has fluctuated since the late 1990s. 
The shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation expectations have 
actually fallen is far from conclusive. Analysis carried out at the Fed and elsewhere suggests 
that the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation has largely been driven 
by  movements  in  inflation  risk  premiums  and  liquidity  concerns  rather  than  by  shifts  in 
inflation expectations.6 In addition, the longer-run measure of inflation expectations from the 
Michigan Survey has historically exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline 
prices, which suggests that this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend 
inflation under current circumstances.7 Moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation 
gleaned from surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the 
Survey  of  Professional  Forecasters,  the  Blue  Chip  survey,  and  the  Survey  of  Primary 
Dealers, have largely moved sideways in the past year or two. Taken together, these results 
suggest that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified. Nevertheless, the 
decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong. If so, 
                                                
6   For  related  background  discussions,  see  Bauer  and  Rudebusch  (2015),  Abrahams  and  others  (2012 
[rev. 2015), and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014). 
7   Similarly, a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable decline 
over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead. However, these readings on 
shorter-term  expectations  may  also  be  influenced  by  current  gasoline  prices.  Moreover,  readings  from  this 
survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of these results.

the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a more 
accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8  
Despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to consider the 
opposite  risk  that  we  are  underestimating  the  speed  at  which  inflation  will  return  to  our 
2 percent  objective.  Economic  growth  here  and  abroad  could  turn  out  to  be  stronger  than 
expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise as well as fall. 
More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from perfect, and it would not be 
all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than expected over the next several 
years.  For  these  reasons,  we  must  continue  to  monitor  incoming  wage  and  price  data 
carefully. 
Monetary policy implications 
Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the baseline 
outlook and associated risks. 
The FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January and March, 
in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier. In particular, 
developments  abroad  imply  that  meeting  our  objectives  for  employment  and  inflation  will 
likely  require  a  somewhat  lower  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  than  was  anticipated  in 
December. 
Given  the  risks  to  the  outlook,  I  consider  it  appropriate  for  the  Committee  to  proceed 
cautiously in adjusting policy. This caution is especially warranted because, with the federal 
funds  rate  so  low,  the  FOMC’s  ability  to  use  conventional  monetary  policy  to  respond  to 
economic  disturbances 
to  strengthen 
considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise its target range for 
the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy. By contrast, if the expansion was to falter or if 
inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be able to provide only a modest 
degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds rate back to near zero.9 
One must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting monetary policy at 
the moment. Even if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero, the FOMC would still 
have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation. In particular, we could use 
the approaches that we and other central banks successfully employed in the wake of the 
financial  crisis  to  put  additional  downward  pressure  on  long-term  interest  rates  and  so 
support  the  economy  –  specifically,  forward  guidance  about  the  future  path  of  the  federal 
funds  rate  and  increases  in  the  size  or  duration  of  our  holdings  of  long-term  securities.10 
If  economic  conditions  were 
is  asymmetric. 
                                                
8   Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably since the turn of the year, 
is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with inflation 
stabilizing  at  2  percent.  Currently,  the  median  of  FOMC  participants’  estimates  of  this  rate  is  4.8  percent. 
However, this longer-run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably higher or lower – 
although  given  low  readings  on  wages  in  recent  years,  I  think  the  latter  possibility  is  more  likely  than  the 
former. If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the labor market, drive 
faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective. 
9   Research suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity of 
the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than would 
be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero. This phenomenon is known as 
“policy  attenuation”  in  the  economic  literature.  For  a  discussion,  see,  for  example,  Adam  and  Billi  (2007), 
Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2015). 
10   With regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming large-
scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. Alternatively, the 
FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its portfolio 
by selling assets with relatively short residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with relatively 
long  residual  maturities.  Studies  suggest  that  either  action  would  reduce  the  term  premiums  embedded  in 
longer-term interest rates considerably.

While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not apply to the federal funds rate, 
we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from the Great Recession, and we would 
do so again if needed.11 
Of course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in the baseline 
outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run. If so, as I emphasized earlier, the 
FOMC  will  adjust  monetary  policy  as  warranted.  As  our  March  decision  and  the  latest 
revisions  to  the  Summary  of  Economic  Projections  demonstrate,  the  Committee  has  not 
embarked on a preset course of tightening. Rather, our actions are data dependent, and the 
FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives. 
Financial  market  participants  appear  to  recognize  the  FOMC’s  data-dependent  approach 
because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market expectations about the 
likely  future  path  of  policy,  resulting  in  movements  in  bond  yields  that  act  to  buffer  the 
economy from shocks. This mechanism serves as an important “automatic stabilizer” for the 
economy. As I have already noted, the decline in market expectations since December for 
the future path of the federal funds rate and accompanying downward pressure on long-term 
interest  rates  have  helped  to  offset  the  contractionary  effects  of  somewhat  less  favorable 
financial conditions and slower foreign growth. In addition, the public’s expectation that the 
Fed will respond to economic disturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset their 
potential harmful effects means that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks – 
a  response  which  serves  to  stabilize  the  expectations  underpinning  hiring  and  spending 
decisions.12 
Such a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the FOMC about 
its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is expected to evolve to 
achieve our economic objectives. I continue to strongly believe that monetary policy is most 
effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing economic and financial developments 
such  as  those I  have  discussed  in  these remarks,  and  when  we  speak  clearly  about  how 
such developments may affect the outlook and the expected path of policy. I have done my

associated risks and at times may be confused about the FOMC’s strategy. In such situations, the Committee 
must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.
