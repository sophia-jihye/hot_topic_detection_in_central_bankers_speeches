Ben S Bernanke: The Federal Reserve – looking back, looking forward 
Speech  by  Mr  Ben  S  Bernanke,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Governors  of  the  US  Federal 
Reserve  System,  at 
the  American  Economic  Association, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 3 January 2014. 
the  Annual  Meeting  of 
 In less than a month my term as Fed Chairman  will end. Needless to  say, my tenure has 
been eventful – for the Federal Reserve, for the country, and for me personally. I thought it 
appropriate  today  to  reflect  on  some  accomplishments  of  the  past  eight  years,  as  well  as 
some  uncompleted  tasks.  I  will  briefly  cover  three  areas  in  my  remarks:  (1)  the  Federal 
Reserve’s commitment to transparency and accountability, (2) financial stability and financial 
reform,  and  (3)  monetary  policy.  I  will  close  by  discussing  the  prospects  for  the  U.S.  and 
global economies. 
Transparency and accountability 
Fostering transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve  was  one of my principal 
objectives  when  I  became  Chairman  in  February  2006.  I  had  long  advocated  increased 
transparency and, in particular, a more explicit policy framework as ways to make monetary 
policy  more  predictable  and  more  effective.  Our  efforts  to  enhance  transparency  and 
communication have indeed made monetary policy more effective, but, as I’ll discuss, these 
steps have proved important in other spheres as well. 
When I began my term I expected to build on the monetary policy framework I had inherited 
from  Paul  Volcker  and  Alan  Greenspan.  My  predecessors  had  solidified  the  Fed’s 
commitment  to  low  and  stable  inflation  as  a  foundation  of  broader  economic  stability,  and 
they  gradually  increased  the  transparency  of  monetary  policy  deliberations  and  plans.  For 
example, Chairman Volcker introduced a money-targeting framework to help guide the Fed’s 
attack on high inflation in the early 1980s, and the practice of issuing a statement after each 
meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began under Chairman Greenspan. 
I  believed  that  a  still  more  transparent  approach  would  make  monetary  policy  even  more 
effective  and  further  strengthen  the  Fed’s  institutional  credibility.  In  particular,  as  an 
academic I had written favorably about the flexible inflation-targeting approach used by the 
Bank  of  England  and  a  number  of  other  central  banks.  By  making  public  considerable 
information about policy goals and strategies, together with their economic forecasts, these 
central  banks  provided  a  clear  framework  to  help  the  public  and  market  participants 
understand and anticipate policy actions. The provision of numerical goals and policy plans 
also helped make these central banks more accountable for achieving their stated objectives. 
I  was  confident  that  we  could  adapt  this  type  of  framework  to  the  Federal  Reserve’s  dual 
mandate  to  promote  both  maximum  employment  and  price  stability.  Indeed,  central  banks 
using  this  framework  were  already,  in  practice,  often  pursuing  economic  objectives  in 
addition to low and stable inflation – hence the term, “flexible” inflation targeting. 
Because  the financial  crisis  and  its  aftermath  naturally  occupied  so  much  of  policymakers’ 
attention,  progress  toward  a  more  explicit  policy  framework  at  the  Federal  Reserve  was 
slower than I had hoped. Nevertheless, progress was made. In the minutes of its October 
2007 meeting, the FOMC introduced its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), 
which  included  FOMC  participants’  projections  of  key  macroeconomic  variables  such  as 
inflation, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and the unemployment rate.1 Over time, we 
                                                
1   Prior  to  October  2007,  FOMC  participants  provided  semiannual  projections  of  nominal  and  real  GDP, 
unemployment,  and  core  inflation,  which  were  reported  in  the  meeting  minutes  and  in  the  Monetary  Policy 
Report to the Congress. The innovations associated with the introduction of the SEP included (1) the switch

added long-run projections of inflation, growth, and unemployment, as well as projections of 
the path of the target federal funds rate consistent with each individual’s views of appropriate 
monetary policy. These additions have better informed the public about participants’ views on 
both  the  long-run  objectives  of  policy  and  the  path  of  interest  rates  most  consistent  with 
achieving those objectives. 
We took another important step in January 2012, when the FOMC issued a statement laying 
out its longer-run goals and policy strategy.2 The statement established, for the first time, an 
explicit  longer-run  goal  for  inflation  of  2  percent,  and  it  pointed  to  the  SEP  to  provide 
information  about  Committee  participants’  assessments  of 
longer-run  normal 
unemployment rate, currently between 5.2 and 6 percent. The statement also indicated that 
the  Committee  would  take  a  balanced  approach  to  its  price  stability  and  employment 
objectives.  We  adopted  additional  measures  aimed  at  clarifying  the  rationales  for  our 
decisions,  including  my  quarterly  postmeeting  press  conference.  The  increases  in  policy 
transparency that were achieved proved valuable during a very difficult period for monetary 
policy. 
As it happened, during the crisis and its aftermath the Federal Reserve’s transparency and 
accountability  proved  critical  in  a  quite  different  sphere  –  namely,  in  supporting  the 
institution’s  democratic  legitimacy.  The  Federal  Reserve,  like  other  central  banks,  wields 
powerful tools; democratic accountability requires that the public be able to see how and for 
what purposes those tools are being used. Transparency is particularly important in a period 
like the recent one in which the Federal Reserve has been compelled to take unusual and 
dramatic actions – including the provision of liquidity to a wide range of financial institutions 
and  markets  that  did  not  normally  have  access  to  the  Fed’s  discount  window  –  to  help 
stabilize the financial system and the economy. 
What  types  of  transparency  are  needed  to  preserve  public  confidence?  At  the  most  basic 
level, a central bank must be clear and open about its actions and operations, particularly 
when  they  involve  the  deployment  of  public  funds.  The  Federal  Reserve  routinely  makes 
public extensive information on all aspects of its activities, and since the crisis it has greatly 
increased  the  quantity  and  detail  of  its  regular  reports  to  the  Congress  and  the  public.3 
Importantly,  contrary  to  what  is  sometimes  asserted,  all  of  the  Fed’s  financial  transactions 
and operations are subject to regular, intensive audits – by the Government Accountability 
Office, an independent Inspector General, and a private accounting firm, as well as by our 
                                                                                                                                                   
from  semiannual  to  quarterly  frequency,  (2)  the  addition  of  projections  for  overall  inflation  (projections  of 
nominal GDP growth were dropped), (3) the extension by two years of the projection horizon, (4) the inclusion 
of  participants’  views  about  the  risks  to  and  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  outlook  for  each  projected 
variable,  (5)  the  inclusion  of  the  full  distribution  of  participants’  projections,  not  just  the  range  and  central 
tendency, and 6) a write-up of the rationales provided by participants for their projections. As noted in the text, 
further  innovations,  including  interest  rate  projections  and  long-run  projections  of  economic  growth, 
unemployment, inflation, and the federal funds rate were added over time. The role of the projections in policy 
communication  was  also  significantly  increased  after  October  2007;  for  example,  they  were  regularly 
referenced in the Chairman’s semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Congress (see Board of 
Governors, 2007a, 2007b). 
2   See Board of Governors (2012b). 
3   For  example,  the  Board  has  regularly  published  detailed  information  about  the  Federal  Reserve’s  balance 
sheet  and  the  special  liquidity  facilities  that  were  introduced  during  the crisis. We created  a section  on  our 
website devoted to these issues and initiated a regular public report as well. (See the webpage “Credit and 
Liquidity Programs and the Balance Sheet “).

own  internal  auditors.4  It  is  a  testament  to  the  dedication  of  the  Federal  Reserve’s 
management  team  that  these  thorough  audits  have  consistently  produced  assessments  of 
the Fed’s accounting and financial controls that most public companies would envy. 
Transparency and accountability are about more than just opening up the books, however; 
they also require thoughtful explanations of what we are doing and why. In this regard, our 
first responsibility is to the Congress, which established the Federal Reserve almost exactly 
a century ago and determined its structure, objectives, and powers. Federal Reserve Board 
members, including the Chairman, of course, as well as senior staff, testify frequently before 
congressional committees on a wide range of topics. When I became Chairman, I anticipated 
the obligation to appear regularly before the Congress. I had not entirely anticipated, though, 
that I would spend so much time meeting with legislators outside of hearings – individually 
and  in  groups.  But  I  quickly  came  to  realize  the  importance  of  these  relationships  with 
legislators in keeping open the channels of communication. As part of the Fed’s interaction 
with the Congress, we have also routinely provided staff briefings on request and conducted 
programs  at the  Board for  the  benefit  of  congressional  staff  interested  in  Federal  Reserve 
issues. I likewise maintained regular contact with both the Bush and Obama Administrations, 
principally through meetings with the Secretary of the Treasury and other economic officials. 
The crisis and its aftermath, however, raised the need for communication and explanation by 
the Federal Reserve to a new level. We took extraordinary measures to meet extraordinary 
economic  challenges,  and  we  had  to  explain  those  measures  to  earn  the  public’s  support 
and  confidence.  Talking  only  to  the  Congress  and  to  market  participants  would  not  have 
been  enough.  The  effort  to  inform  the  public  engaged  the  whole  institution,  including  both 
Board  members  and  the  staff.  As  Chairman,  I  did  my  part,  by  appearing  on  television 
programs, holding town halls, taking student questions at universities, and visiting a military 
base to talk to soldiers and their families. The Federal Reserve Banks also played key roles 
in  providing  public  information  in  their  Districts,  through  programs,  publications,  speeches, 
and other media. 
The crisis has passed, but I think the Fed’s need to educate and explain will only grow. When 
Paul Volcker first sat in the Chairman’s office in 1979, there were no financial news channels 
on cable TV, no Bloomberg screens, no blogs, no Twitter. Today, news, ideas, and rumors 
circulate  almost  instantaneously.  The  Fed  must  continue  to  find  ways  to  navigate  this 
changing environment while providing clear, objective, and reliable information to the public. 
Financial stability 
For the U.S. and global economies, the most important event of the past eight years was, of 
course, the global financial crisis and the deep recession that it triggered. As I have observed 
on other occasions, the crisis bore a strong family resemblance to a classic financial panic, 
                                                
4   While the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and is 
free to criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception: monetary policymaking. In the 
1970s,  the  Congress  deliberately  excluded  monetary  policy  deliberations,  decisions,  and  actions  from  the 
scope of GAO reviews. In doing so, the Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountability 
with the benefits that flow from keeping monetary policy free from short-term political pressures. 
  However, there have been recent proposals (so-called Audit the Fed measures) to expand the authority of the 
GAO  over  the  Federal  Reserve  to  include  reviews  of  monetary  policy  decisions.  Because  the  GAO  is  the 
investigative  arm  of  the  Congress  and  GAO  reviews  may  be  initiated  at  the  request  of  members  of  the 
Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of individual policy decisions could be seen, with good 
reason, as efforts to bring political pressure to bear on monetary policymakers. A perceived politicization of 
monetary  policy  would  reduce  public  confidence  in  the  ability  of  the  Federal  Reserve  to  make  its  policy 
decisions  based  strictly  on  what  is  good  for  the  economy  in  the  longer  term.  Balancing  the  need  for 
accountability  against  the  goal  of  insulating  monetary  policy  from  short-term  political  pressures  is  very 
important, and I believe that the Congress had it right in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary 
policy decision-making from the possibility of politically motivated reviews.

except  that  it  took  place  in  the  complex  environment  of  the  21st  century  global  financial 
system.5 Likewise, the tools used to fight the panic, though adapted to the modern context, 
were  analogous  to  those  that  would  have  been  used  a  century  ago,  including  liquidity 
provision  by  the  central  bank,  liability  guarantees,  recapitalization,  and  the  provision  of 
assurances and information to the public. 
The immediate trigger of the crisis, as you know, was a sharp decline in house prices, which 
reversed  a  previous  run-up  that  had  been  fueled  by  irresponsible  mortgage  lending  and 
securitization practices. Policymakers at the time, including myself, certainly appreciated that 
house  prices  might  decline,  although  we  disagreed  about  how  much  decline  was  likely; 
indeed,  prices  were  already  moving  down  when  I  took  office  in  2006.  However,  to  a 
significant extent, our expectations about the possible macroeconomic effects of house price 
declines were shaped by the apparent analogy to the bursting of the dot-com bubble a few 
years  earlier.  That  earlier  bust  also  involved  a  large  reduction  in  paper  wealth  but  was 
followed by only a mild recession. In the event, of course, the bursting of the housing bubble 
helped trigger the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. It did so because, 
unlike  the  earlier  decline  in  equity  prices,  it  interacted  with  critical  vulnerabilities  in  the 
financial  system  and  in  government  regulation  that  allowed  what  were  initially  moderate 
aggregate losses to subprime mortgage holders to cascade through the financial system. In 
the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage, excessive dependence 
on unstable short-term funding, deficiencies in risk measurement and management, and the 
use of exotic financial instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways. In the public 
sector,  vulnerabilities  included  gaps  in  the  regulatory  structure  that  allowed  some 
systemically  important firms and markets to escape comprehensive supervision, failures of 
supervisors to effectively use their existing powers, and insufficient attention to threats to the 
stability of the system as a whole. 
The  Federal  Reserve  responded  forcefully  to  the  liquidity  pressures  during  the  crisis  in  a 
manner consistent with the lessons that central banks had learned from financial panics over 
more  than  150  years  and  summarized  in  the  writings  of  the  19th  century  British  journalist 
Walter  Bagehot:  Lend  early  and  freely  to  solvent  institutions.6  However,  the  institutional 
context  had  changed  substantially  since  Bagehot  wrote.  The  panics  of  the  19th  and  early 
20th centuries typically involved runs on commercial banks and other depository institutions. 
Prior to the recent crisis, in contrast, credit extension had progressively migrated outside of 
traditional banking to so-called shadow banking entities, which relied heavily on short-term 
wholesale funding that proved vulnerable to runs.7 Accordingly, to help calm the panic, the 
Federal Reserve provided liquidity not only to commercial banks, but also to other types of 
financial institutions such as investment banks and money market funds, as well as to key 
financial markets such as those for commercial paper and asset-backed securities.8 Because

6   As  noted  in  Lombard  Street,  by  Bagehot  ([1873]  1897).  For  a  more  extensive  discussion  of  the  manner  in 
which the Federal Reserve’s actions during the crisis followed traditional prescriptions regarding the proper 
response to liquidity strains, see Madigan (2009). 
7   Shadow  banking,  as  usually  defined,  comprises  a  diverse  set  of  institutions  and  markets  that,  collectively, 
carry  out  traditional banking  functions  –  but  do  so  outside,  or  in  ways  only  loosely  linked  to,  the  traditional 
system of regulated depository institutions. Examples of important components of the shadow banking system 
include  securitization  vehicles,  asset-backed  commercial  paper  conduits,  money  market  funds,  markets  for 
repurchase agreements, investment banks, and nonbank mortgage companies. 
8   Liquidity tools employed by the Federal Reserve that were closely tied to the central bank’s traditional role as 
lender of last resort involved the provision of short-term liquidity to depository and other financial institutions 
and  included  the  traditional  discount  window,  the  Term  Auction  Facility  (TAF),  the  Primary  Dealer  Credit 
Facility (PDCF), and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). A second set of tools involved the provision 
of  liquidity  directly  to  borrowers  and  investors  in  those  credit  markets  key  to  households  and  businesses 
where  the  expanding  crisis  threatened  to  materially  impede  the  availability  of  financing.  The  Asset-Backed 
Commercial  Paper  Money  Market  Mutual  Fund  Liquidity  Facility  (AMLF),  the  Commercial  Paper  Funding

funding  markets  are  global  in  scope  and  U.S.  borrowers  depend  importantly  on  foreign 
lenders,  the  Federal  Reserve  also  approved  currency  swap  agreements  with  14  foreign 
central banks. 
Providing  liquidity  represented  only  the  first  step  in  stabilizing  the  financial  system. 
Subsequent  efforts  focused  on  rebuilding  the  public’s  confidence,  notably  including  public 
guarantees of bank debt by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and of money market 
funds  by  the  Treasury  Department,  as  well  as  the  injection  of  public  capital  into  banking 
institutions. The bank stress test that the Federal Reserve led in the spring of 2009, which 
included detailed public disclosure of information regarding the solvency of our largest banks, 
further  buttressed  confidence  in  the  banking  system.  The  success  of  the  stress-test 
disclosures, by the way, was yet another example of the benefits of transparency. 
The subsequent efforts to reform our regulatory framework have been focused on limiting the 
reemergence of the vulnerabilities that precipitated and exacerbated the crisis. Changes in 
bank  capital  regulation  under  Basel  III  have  significantly  increased  requirements  for  loss-
absorbing capital at global banking firms – including a surcharge for systemically important 
institutions  and  a  ceiling  on  leverage.  The  Federal  Reserve’s  Comprehensive  Capital 
Analysis and Review, or CCAR, process, a descendant of the 2009 stress test, requires that 
large financial institutions maintain sufficient capital to weather extreme shocks, and that they 
demonstrate that their internal planning processes are effective; in addition, public disclosure 
of  the  results  facilitates  market  discipline.  The  Basel  III  framework  also  includes  liquidity 
requirements  designed  to  mitigate  excessive  reliance  by  global  banks  on  short-term 
wholesale funding and to otherwise constrain risks at those banks. Further steps are under 
way  to  toughen  the  oversight  of  large  institutions  and  to  strengthen  the  financial 
infrastructure,  for  example,  by  requiring  central  clearing  with  greater  transparency  for  the 
trading of most standardized derivatives. 
Oversight of the shadow banking system also has been strengthened. For example, the new 
Financial  Stability  Oversight  Council  has  designated  some  nonbank  firms  as  systemically 
important financial institutions, or SIFIs, subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal 
Reserve. In addition, measures are being undertaken to address the potential instability of 
short-term  wholesale  funding  markets,  including  reforms  to  money  market  funds  and  the 
triparty repo market.9  
Of course, in a highly integrated global financial system, no country can effectively implement 
the financial reforms I have described in isolation. The good news is that similar reforms are 
being  pursued  throughout  the  world,  with  the  full  support  of  the  United  States  and  with 
international bodies such as the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board providing 
coordination. 
More  broadly,  the  approach  to  regulation  and  supervision  at  the  Federal  Reserve  has 
evolved to include a substantial macroprudential, or systemic, orientation in addition to the 
traditional  focus  on  individual  institutions.  For  example,  the  Federal  Reserve  created  the 
Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which coordinates System efforts to monitor 
the  interaction  of  financial  institutions,  financial  markets,  and  economic  developments  to 
identify  emerging  vulnerabilities  and  systemic  risks.10  Enhanced  monitoring  of  this  type  is 
especially important as the changes in regulatory structure and financial innovation may lead 
risks to manifest in new ways or to migrate outside the perimeter of the current regulatory 
structure. 
                                                                                                                                                   
Facility (CPFF), the Money Market Investor Funding Facility (MMIFF), and the Term Asset-Backed Securities 
Loan Facility (TALF) fall into this category. 
9   For a more comprehensive discussion of changes in the regulatory framework, see Tarullo (2013). 
10   This monitoring framework is discussed in, for example, Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013).

Much progress has been made, but more remains to be done. In addition to completing the 
efforts  I  have  already  mentioned,  including  the  full  implementation  of  new  rules  and 
supervisory  responsibilities,  the  agenda  still  includes  further  domestic  and  international 
cooperation  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  mechanisms  to  allow  the  orderly  resolution  of 
insolvent  institutions  and  thereby  increase  market  discipline  on  large  institutions.11  The 
evaluation  of  potential  macroprudential  tools  that  might  be  used  to  address  emerging 
financial imbalances is another high priority. For example, the new Basel III regulatory capital 
framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which may help build additional resilience 
within  the  financial  sector  during  periods  of  buoyant  credit  creation.  Staff  members  are 
investigating the potential of this and other regulatory tools, such as cyclically sensitive loan-
to-value  requirements  for  mortgages,  to  improve  financial  stability.  A  number  of  countries, 
including  both  advanced  and  emerging-market  economies,  have  already  deployed  such 
measures,  and  their  experiences  should  be  instructive.  Although,  in  principle,  monetary 
policy  can  be  used  to  address  financial  imbalances,  the  presumption  remains  that 
macroprudential  tools,  together  with  well-focused  traditional  regulation  and  supervision, 
should  serve  as  the  first  line  of  defense  against  emerging  threats  to  financial  stability. 
However, more remains to be done to better understand how to design and implement more 
effective macroprudential tools and how these tools interact with monetary policy. 
Monetary policy 
While liquidity provision  and other emergency steps were critical to stemming the financial 
panic, a rapid shift in the stance of monetary policy was necessary to counteract the massive 
economic blow delivered by the crisis. The FOMC reduced the target federal funds rate from 
5–1/4 percent in the summer of 2007 to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the end of 2008, a 
very rapid easing. The federal funds rate has been at its effective lower bound since then. 
To provide additional monetary policy accommodation despite the constraint imposed by the 
effective lower bound on interest rates, the Federal Reserve turned to two alternative tools: 
enhanced forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and large-scale 
purchases of longer-term securities for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio. Other major central 
banks  have  responded  to  developments  since  2008  in  roughly  similar  ways.  For  example, 
the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have employed detailed forward guidance and 
conducted  large-scale  asset  purchases,  while  the  European  Central  Bank  has  moved  to 
reduce  the  perceived  risk  of  sovereign  debt,  provided  banks  with  substantial  liquidity,  and 
offered qualitative guidance regarding the future path of interest rates. 
With  short-term  rates  near  zero,  expanded  guidance  about  intentions  for  future  policy  has 
helped to shape market expectations, which in turn has eased financial conditions by putting 
downward  pressure  on  longer-term  interest  rates  and  helped  support  economic  activity. 
Forward  guidance  about  the  short-term  interest  rate  supplements  the  broader  policy 
framework I described earlier, by providing information about how the Committee expects to 
achieve  its  stated  policy  objectives  despite  the  complications  created  by  the  zero  lower 
bound  on  the  policy  interest  rate  and  uncertainties  about  the  costs  and  efficacy  of  the 
available policy tools. Beginning with qualitative guidance, the Committee’s communication 
about  its  anticipated future  policy  has  evolved  through  several  stages. In  December  2012, 
the  Committee  introduced  state-contingent  guidance,  announcing  for  the  first  time  that  no 
increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  target  should  be  anticipated  so  long  as  unemployment 
remained above 6–1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead was projected to 
be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, 
                                                
11   The  Dodd-Frank  Act,  under  the  orderly  liquidation  authority  in  Title  II,  created  an  alternative  resolution 
mechanism for SIFIs that takes into account both the need, for moral hazard reasons, to impose costs on the 
creditors of failing firms and the need to protect financial stability; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
with the cooperation of the Federal Reserve, has been hard at work fleshing out this authority.

 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
and longer-term inflation expectations continued to be well anchored.12 My colleagues and I 
emphasized that the conditions stated in that guidance were thresholds, not triggers. That is, 
crossing one of the thresholds would not automatically give rise to an increase in the federal 
funds rate target; instead, it would signal only that it would be appropriate for the Committee 
to begin considering, based on a wider range of indicators, whether and when an increase in 
the target might be warranted. 
Large-scale asset purchases also provide monetary accommodation by  lowering long-term 
interest  rates.  Working  through  the  portfolio-balance  channel,  asset  purchases  reduce  the 
supply of long-duration assets in the hands of the public, depressing term premiums and thus 
reducing  longer-term  yields.  At  times,  the  decision  to  begin  or  extend  an  asset-purchase 
program  may  also  have  a  signaling  effect,  to  the  extent  that  market  participants  see  that 
decision  as  indicative  of  policymakers’  commitment  to  an  accommodative  policy  stance. 
However, it is important to recognize that the potential signaling aspect of asset purchases 
depends on the broader economic and policy context. In particular, the FOMC’s decision to 
modestly reduce the pace of asset purchases at its December meeting did not indicate any 
diminution of its commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long 
as  needed;  rather,  it  reflected  the  progress  we  have  made  toward  our  goal  of  substantial 
improvement  in  the  labor  market  outlook  that  we  set  out  when  we  began  the  current 
purchase program in September 2012. At its most recent meeting, the Committee reaffirmed 
and clarified its guidance on rates, stating that it expects to maintain the current target range 
for  the  federal  funds  rate  well  past  the  time  that  the  unemployment  threshold  of  
6–1/2 percent  is  crossed,  especially  if  projected  inflation  continues  to  run  below  the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.13  
Have these unconventional tools been effective? Skeptics have pointed out that the pace of 
recovery has been disappointingly slow, with inflation-adjusted GDP growth averaging only 
slightly higher than a 2 percent annual rate over the past few years and inflation below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-term target. However, as I will discuss, the recovery has faced 
powerful  headwinds,  suggesting  that  economic  growth  might  well  have  been  considerably 
weaker,  or  even  negative,  without  substantial  monetary  policy  support.  For  the  most  part, 
research supports the conclusion that the combination of forward guidance and large-scale 
asset  purchases  has  helped  promote  the  recovery.  For  example,  changes  in  guidance 
appear to shift interest rate expectations, and the preponderance of studies show that asset 
purchases push down longer-term interest rates and boost asset prices.14 These changes in 
financial conditions in turn appear to have provided material support to the economy.15  
Once the economy improves sufficiently so that unconventional tools are no longer needed, 
the  Committee  will  face  issues  of  policy  implementation  and,  ultimately,  the  design  of  the 
policy framework. Large-scale asset purchases have increased the size of our balance sheet 
and  created  substantial  excess  reserves  in  the  banking  system.  Under  the  operating 
procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves likely 
would  have  impeded  the  FOMC’s  ability  to  raise  short-term  nominal  interest  rates  when

13   For the most recent FOMC statement, see Board of Governors (2013). 
14   There is a substantial recent research literature that has tried to quantify the effects of balance sheet policies 
on  asset  pricing.  For  example,  see  D’Amico  and  King  (2013)  and  Krishnamurthy  and  Vissing-Jorgenson 
(2011). Research on the effects on mortgage rates includes Hancock and Passmore (2011). Research on the 
effects  on  corporate  bond  yields  includes  Gilchrist  and  Zakrajšek  (2013)  and  Kiley  (2013);  Kiley 
(forthcoming b) examines the effects on U.S. equity prices. For a recent study of the effectiveness of forward 
guidance, see Femia, Friedman, and Sack (2013). 
15   The  range  of  macroeconomic  frameworks  used  to  judge  the  effects  of  these  policy  actions  reflects  the 
diversity of views within the profession of how to model the relevant empirical links, for example, Chung and 
others (2012); Fuhrer and Olivei (2011); Chen, Cúrdia, and Ferrero (2012); and Kiley (forthcoming a).

appropriate. However, the Federal Reserve now has effective tools to normalize the stance 
of  policy  when  conditions  warrant,  without  reliance  on  asset  sales.  The  interest  rate  on 
excess  reserves  can  be  raised,  which  will  put  upward  pressure  on  short-term  rates;  in 
addition, the Federal Reserve will be able to employ other tools, such as fixed-rate overnight 
reverse  repurchase  agreements,  term  deposits,  or  term  repurchase  agreements,  to  drain 
bank reserves and tighten its control over money market rates if this proves necessary. As a 
result, at the appropriate time, the FOMC will be able to return to conducting monetary policy 
primarily through adjustments in the short-term policy rate. It is possible, however, that some 
specific aspects of the Federal Reserve’s operating framework will change; the Committee 
will  be  considering  this  question  in  the  future,  taking  into  account  what  it  learned  from  its 
experience with an expanded balance sheet and new tools for managing interest rates. 
Economic prospects 
In the remainder of my remarks, I will reflect on the state of the U.S. economic recovery and 
its prospects. 
The economy has made considerable progress since the recovery officially began some four 
and  a  half  years  ago.  Payroll  employment  has  risen  by  7–1/2  million  jobs  from  its  trough. 
Real GDP has grown in 16 of 17 quarters, and the level of real GDP in the third quarter of 
2013  was  5–1/2  percent  above  its  pre-recession  peak.  The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen 
from 10 percent in the fall of 2009 to 7 percent recently. Industrial production and equipment 
investment have matched or exceeded pre-recession peaks. The banking system has been 
recapitalized,  and  the financial  system  is  safer. When  the  economy  was  in  free fall  in  late 
2008  and  early  2009,  such  improvement  was  far  from  certain,  as  indicated  at  the  time  by 
stock prices that were nearly 60 percent below current levels and very wide credit spreads. 
Despite  this  progress,  the  recovery  clearly  remains  incomplete.  At  7  percent,  the 
unemployment rate still is elevated. The number of long-term unemployed remains unusually 
high, and other measures of labor underutilization, such as the number of people who are 
working  part  time for  economic  reasons,  have  improved  less  than  the unemployment  rate. 
Labor force participation has continued to decline, and, although some of this decline reflects 
longer-term  trends  that  were  in  place  prior  to  the  crisis,  some  of  it  likely  reflects  potential 
workers’ discouragement about job prospects. 
In  retrospect,  at  least,  many  of  the  factors  that  held  back  the  recovery  can  be  identified. 
Some of these factors were difficult or impossible to anticipate, such as the resurgence in 
financial  volatility  associated  with  the  European sovereign  debt  and  banking  crisis  and the 
economic  effects  of  natural  disasters  in  Japan  and  elsewhere.  Other  factors  were  more 
predictable; in particular, we appreciated early on, though perhaps to a lesser extent than we 
might have, that the boom and bust left severe imbalances that would take time to work off. 
As  Carmen  Reinhart  and  Ken  Rogoff  noted  in  their  prescient  research,  economic  activity 
following  financial  crises  tends  to  be  anemic,  especially  when  the  preceding  economic 
expansion  was  accompanied  by  rapid  growth  in  credit  and  real  estate  prices.16  Weak 
recoveries  from  financial  crises  reflect,  in  part,  the  process  of  deleveraging  and  balance 
sheet  repair:  Households  pull  back  on  spending  to  recoup  lost  wealth  and  reduce  debt 
burdens,  while  financial  institutions  restrict  credit  to  restore  capital  ratios  and  reduce  the 
riskiness  of  their  portfolios.  In  addition  to  these  financial  factors,  the  weakness  of  the 
recovery reflects the overbuilding of housing (and, to some extent, commercial real estate) 
prior to the crisis, together with tight mortgage credit; indeed, recent activity in these areas is 
especially  tepid  in  comparison  to  the  rapid  gains  in  construction  more  typically  seen  in 
recoveries.

Although the Federal Reserve, like other forecasters, has tended to be overoptimistic in its 
forecasts of real GDP during this recovery, we have also, at times, been too pessimistic in 
our forecasts of the unemployment rate. For example, over the past year unemployment has 
declined notably more quickly than we or other forecasters expected, even as GDP growth 
was  moderately  lower  than  expected  a  year  ago.  This  discrepancy  reflects  a  number  of 
factors,  including  declines  in  participation,  but  an  important  reason  is  the  slow  growth  of 
productivity during this recovery; intuitively,  when productivity gains are limited, firms need 
more  workers  even  if  demand  is  growing  slowly.  Disappointing  productivity  growth 
accordingly must be added to the list of reasons that economic growth has been slower than 
hoped.17  (Incidentally,  the  slow  pace  of  productivity  gains  early  in  the  recovery  was  not 
evident  until  well  after  the  fact  because  of  large  data  revisions  –  an  illustration  of  the 
frustrations  of  real-time  policymaking.)  The  reasons  for  weak  productivity  growth  are  not 
entirely  clear:  It  may  be  a  result  of  the  severity  of  the  financial  crisis,  for  example,  if  tight 
credit  conditions  have  inhibited  innovation,  productivity-improving  investments,  and  the 
formation of new firms; or it may simply reflect slow growth in sales, which have led firms to 
use capital and labor less intensively, or even mismeasurement. Notably, productivity growth 
has also flagged in a number of foreign economies that were hard-hit by the financial crisis. 
Yet  another  possibility  is  weak  productivity  growth  reflects  longer-term  trends  largely 
unrelated  to  the  recession.  Obviously,  the  resolution  of  the  productivity  puzzle  will  be 
important in shaping our expectations for longer-term growth. 
To this list of reasons for the slow recovery – the effects of the financial crisis, problems in 
the housing and mortgage markets, weaker-than-expected productivity growth, and events in 
Europe  and  elsewhere  –  I  would  add  one  more  significant  factor  –  namely,  fiscal  policy. 
Federal fiscal policy was expansionary in 2009 and 2010.18 Since that time, however, federal 
fiscal policy has turned quite restrictive; according to the Congressional Budget Office, tax 
increases  and  spending  cuts  likely  lowered  output  growth  in  2013  by  as  much  as  
1–1/2  percentage  points.  In  addition,  throughout  much  of  the  recovery,  state  and  local 
government budgets have been highly contractionary, reflecting their adjustment to sharply 
declining tax revenues. To illustrate the extent of fiscal tightness, at the current point in the 
recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at all levels of government had increased by 
nearly  600,000  workers;  in  contrast,  in  the  current  recovery,  government  employment  has 
declined  by  more  than 700,000 jobs,  a  net  difference  of more than  1.3  million  jobs. There 
have  been  corresponding  cuts  in  government  investment,  in  infrastructure for  example,  as 
well as increases in taxes and reductions in transfers. 
Although long-term fiscal sustainability is a critical objective, excessively tight near-term fiscal 
policies have likely been counterproductive. Most importantly, with fiscal and monetary policy 
working  in  opposite  directions,  the  recovery  is  weaker  than  it  otherwise  would  be.  But  the 
current policy mix is particularly problematic when interest rates are very low, as is the case 
today.  Monetary  policy  has  less  room  to  maneuver  when  interest  rates  are  close  to  zero, 
while  expansionary  fiscal  policy  is  likely  both  more  effective  and  less  costly  in  terms  of 
increased debt burden when interest rates are pinned at low levels. A more balanced policy 
mix might also avoid some of the costs of very low interest rates, such as potential risks to 
financial stability, without sacrificing jobs and growth. 
I have discussed the factors that have held back the recovery, not only to better understand 
the recent past but also to think about the economy’s prospects. The encouraging news is 
that  the  headwinds  I  have  mentioned  may  now  be  abating.  Near-term  fiscal  policy  at  the 
federal level remains restrictive, but the degree of restraint on economic growth seems likely 
to lessen somewhat in 2014 and even more so in 2015; meanwhile, the budgetary situations

of state and local governments have improved, reducing the need for further sharp cuts. The 
aftereffects  of  the  housing  bust  also  appear  to have  waned.  For  example,  notwithstanding 
the  effects  of  somewhat  higher  mortgage  rates,  house  prices  have  rebounded,  with  one 
consequence  being  that  the  number  of  homeowners  with  “underwater”  mortgages  has 
dropped significantly, as have foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies. Household balance 
sheets  have  strengthened  considerably,  with  wealth  and  income  rising  and  the  household 
debt-service burden at its lowest level in decades. Partly as a result of households’ improved 
finances,  lending  standards  to  households  are  showing  signs  of  easing,  though  potential 
mortgage borrowers still face impediments. Businesses, especially larger ones, are also in 
good financial shape. The combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing 
market,  less  fiscal  restraint,  and,  of  course,  continued  monetary  policy  accommodation 
bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters. But, of course, if the experience of 
the past few years teaches us anything, it is that we should be cautious in our forecasts. 
What about the rest of the world? The U.S. recovery appears to be somewhat ahead of those 
of most other advanced industrial economies; for example, real GDP is still slightly below its 
pre-recession  peak  in  Japan  and  remains  2  percent  and  3  percent  below  pre-recession 
peaks  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  euro  area,  respectively.  Nevertheless,  I  see  some 
grounds for cautious optimism abroad as well. As in the United States, central banks in other 
advanced  economies  have  taken  significant  steps  to  strengthen  financial  systems  and  to 
provide policy accommodation. Financial-sector reform is proceeding, and the contractionary 
effects of tight fiscal policies are  waning. Although difficult reforms – such as banking and 
fiscal reform in Europe and structural reform in Japan – are still in early stages, we have also 
seen  indications  of  better  growth  in  the  advanced  economies,  which  should  have  positive 
implications for the United States. Emerging market economies have also grown somewhat 
more quickly lately after a slowing in the first half of 2013. Although growth prospects for the 
emerging markets  continue  to be good,  here too  the  extent  and  effectiveness  of  structural 
reforms, like those currently under way in China and Mexico, will be critical factors. 
Conclusion 
Last month we had a ceremony at the Board to commemorate the centennial of the signing 
of the Federal Reserve Act by President Woodrow Wilson. Over its 100 years of existence, 
the Fed has faced numerous economic and financial challenges. Certainly the past few years 
will  rank  among  some  of  the  more  difficult  for  the  U.S.  economy  and  for  the  Fed.  The 
experience  has  led  to  important  changes  at  our  institution,  including  new  monetary  policy 
tools,  enhanced  policy  communication,  a  substantial  increase  in  the  institutional  focus  on 
financial stability and macroprudential policy, and increased transparency. 
We  often  speak  of  the  Federal  Reserve  or  other  institutions  as  if  they  were  autonomous 
actors.  Of  course,  they  are  not.  The  Fed  is  made  up  of  people,  working  within  an 
organizational structure and with an institutional culture and set of values. I am very proud of 
my  colleagues  at  the  Fed  for  the  hard  work  and  creativity  they  have  brought  to  bear  in 
addressing the financial and economic crisis, and I think we and they have been well served 
by  a  culture  that  emphasizes  objective,  expert  analysis;  professionalism;  dedication;  and 
independence from political influence. Whatever the Fed may have achieved in recent years 
reflects  the  efforts  of  many  people  who  are  committed,  individually  and  collectively,  to 
pursuing the public interest. Although the Fed undoubtedly will face some difficult challenges 
in  the  years  ahead,  our  people  and  our  values  make  me  confident  that  our  institution  will 
meet those challenges successfully.
