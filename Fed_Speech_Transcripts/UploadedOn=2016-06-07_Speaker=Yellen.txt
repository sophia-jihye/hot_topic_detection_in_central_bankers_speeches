   Janet L Yellen: Current conditions and the outlook for the US economy 
Speech by Ms Janet L Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 6 June 2016. 
 The Footnotes can be found at the end of the speech. 
I am delighted to be with you today. I will discuss recent economic developments, the outlook, 
and  their  implications  for  monetary  policy.  My  message  will  be  largely  favorable,  although 
recent  developments  have  been  mixed.  Most  importantly,  the  economy  has  registered 
considerable  progress  over  the  past  several  years  toward  the  Federal  Reserve’s  goals  of 
maximum employment and price stability, and, as I will explain, there are good reasons to 
expect that we will advance further toward those goals. The news from the labor market over 
the  past  year  has  been  generally  good,  with  significant  job  gains,  the  unemployment  rate 
declining below 5 percent, rising household incomes, and tentative signs of faster wage growth. 
At the same time, recent signs of a slowdown in job creation bear close watching. Inflation has 
been lower than our objective of 2 percent, but I expect it to move up over time for reasons 
that I will describe. If incoming data are consistent with labor market conditions strengthening 
and  inflation  making  progress  toward  our  2  percent  objective,  as  I  expect,  further  gradual 
increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate and most conducive to meeting 
and maintaining those objectives. However, I will emphasize that monetary policy is not on a 
preset  course  and  significant  shifts  in  the  outlook  for  the  economy  would  necessitate 
corresponding shifts in the appropriate path of policy. 
In  particular,  an  important  theme  of  my  remarks  today  will  be  the  inevitable  uncertainty 
surrounding the outlook for the economy. Unfortunately, all economic projections are certain 
to turn out to be inaccurate in some respects, and possibly significantly so. Will the economic 
situation  in  Europe  or  China  take  a  turn  for  the  worse  or  exceed  expectations?  Will  U.S. 
productivity growth pick up and allow stronger growth of gross domestic product (GDP) and 
incomes  or  instead  continue  to  stagnate?  What  will  happen  with  the  price  of  oil?  The 
uncertainties are sizable, and progress toward our goals and, by implication, the appropriate 
stance of monetary policy will depend on how these uncertainties evolve. Indeed, the policy 
path that my colleagues and I judge most likely to achieve and maintain maximum employment 
and price stability has evolved and will continue to evolve in response to developments that 
alter our economic outlook and the associated risks to that outlook. 
The current economic situation 
The economic expansion following the Great Recession has now been under way for seven 
years. The recovery has not always been smooth, but overall, the gains have been impressive. 
In particular, the job market has strengthened substantially, and I believe we are now close to 
eliminating the slack that has weighed on the labor market since the recession. 
I will turn to this past Friday’s labor market report in a moment, but let me begin with some 
background: The economy added 2.7 million jobs last year, an average of about 230,000 a 
month. In the first three months of this year, payrolls were growing only modestly slower, at a 
little less than a 200,000 monthly pace. The unemployment rate had fallen to 5 percent, down 
from a peak of 10 percent in 2009. In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ measure of the 
job openings rate was at a record high in March, and the quits rate – the share of employees 
voluntarily leaving their jobs – has moved up and in March stood close to its pre-recession 
levels.1 The increase in the quits rate is a sign that workers are feeling more confident about 
the job market and are likely receiving more job offers. 
So the overall labor market situation has been quite positive. In that context, this past Friday’s 
labor market report was disappointing. Payroll gains were reported to have been much smaller 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

   in April and May than earlier in the year, averaging only about 80,000 per month.2 And while 
the unemployment rate was reported to have fallen further in May, that decline occurred not 
because more  people  had jobs  but  because fewer  people  reported that they  were  actively 
seeking  work.  A  broader  measure  of  labor  market  slack  that  includes  workers  marginally 
attached to the workforce and those working part-time who would prefer full-time work was 
unchanged. An encouraging aspect of the report, however, was that average hourly earnings 
for  all  employees  in  the  nonfarm  private  sector  increased  2-1/2 percent  over  the  past  12 
months – a bit faster than in recent years and a welcome indication that wage growth may 
finally be picking up.3 
Although this recent labor market report was, on balance, concerning, let me emphasize that 
one  should  never  attach  too  much  significance  to  any  single  monthly  report.  Other  timely 
indicators from the labor market have been more positive. For example, the number of people 
filing new claims for unemployment insurance – which can be a good early indicator of changes 
in labor market conditions – remains quite low, and the public’s perceptions of the health of the 
labor market, as reported in various consumer surveys, remain positive. That said, the monthly 
labor market report is an important economic indicator, and so we will need to watch labor 
market developments carefully. 
Economic conditions here in the Philadelphia metropolitan area have improved broadly in line 
with  national  trends.  During  the  downturn,  the  Philadelphia  area  and  the  city  itself  saw 
unemployment rise by less than it did for the nation as a whole, but unemployment took longer 
to recover thereafter.4 In the City of Philadelphia, in particular, unemployment was still running 
above 10 percent as recently as 2013. But unemployment here has fallen appreciably since 
then, helped by a revival in residential and commercial construction that is evident around the 
city. 
While the general picture of the labor market is largely positive, some people are still struggling. 
Unemployment rates rose more during the recession for African Americans and Hispanics than 
for the nation overall, and even though those rates have also come down by more during the 
economic expansion, unemployment remains higher for these groups. Unfortunately, those 
gaps  have  not  narrowed  noticeably  relative  to  where  they  were  before  the  recession. 
Unemployment rates for young African American and Hispanic men without a college degree 
remain especially high, and one important benefit from further improvement in the labor market 
would  be  increased  job  opportunities  for  these  men  and  other  groups  that  currently  still 
experience high unemployment. To be sure, many of the factors that contribute to the labor 
market  outcomes  of  minority  groups  are  not  amenable  to  monetary  policy,  and  measures 
beyond  the  scope  of  monetary  policy  should  be  considered  to  alleviate  the  economic 
challenges that these and other Americans face. Education and training, of course, are vital. 
Later today, I will visit one program that helps workers in West Philadelphia learn new skills 
and  then  connects  them  with  potential  employers,  an  initiative  in  which  government, 
businesses, and local institutions are working together successfully. 
While  the  economy  has  made  great  strides  toward  the  FOMC’s  objective  of  maximum 
employment, somewhat less progress has been made toward our inflation objective. Inflation 
has run persistently below the Fed’s goal of 2 percent over the past several years even as the 
labor market strengthened significantly.5 Over the 12 months through April, the price index for 
personal  consumption  expenditures  rose  only  about  1  percent.  But  I  remain  optimistic, 
because two factors that have been holding down inflation will likely prove only temporary. 
First, the sharp drop in crude oil prices since the middle of 2014 has lowered prices of gasoline 
and other energy products, significantly restraining overall inflation. At about the same time, 
the foreign exchange value of the dollar strengthened, holding down prices of imported goods. 
But oil prices have stopped declining and indeed have risen from their low point earlier this 
year. And, since the beginning of the year, the dollar has been roughly unchanged against a 
broad  basket  of  currencies.  As  the  downward  pressure  on  prices  from  these  two  forces 
dissipates and as the labor market strengthens further, I expect inflation to move back to 2 
percent.

   The economic outlook 
Let  me  now  turn  to  the  outlook  for  the  economy.  GDP  growth  was  reported  to  have  been 
relatively  weak  early  this  year,  but  this  measure  of  growth  in  economic  activity  can  vary 
significantly from quarter to quarter. Indeed, while spending data for the second quarter are 
limited at present, recent data on retail sales and motor vehicle sales point to a significant step-
up in consumer spending and GDP growth this quarter.6  
Stepping back from near-term indicators, I would like to focus more broadly on the factors likely 
to affect economic performance over the coming years. Next week, concurrent with our policy 
meeting, the FOMC participants will release a new set of economic projections. Those could, 
of course, differ from the previous set of such projections in March. But speaking for myself, 
although the economy recently has been affected by a mix of countervailing forces, I see good 
reasons to expect that the positive forces supporting employment growth and higher inflation 
will continue to outweigh the negative ones. As a result, I expect the economic expansion to 
continue, with the labor market improving further and GDP growing moderately. And as I just 
noted, I expect to see inflation moving up to 2 percent over the next couple of years. 
Let me start with the positive. The increase in employment over the past several years has 
contributed to higher household incomes and strengthening consumer confidence. If the May 
labor report was an aberration or reflects a temporary slowdown resulting from the weakness 
in economic activity at the start of the year, then job growth should pick up and support further 
gains in income. In addition, rising equity and house prices have helped restore households’ 
wealth.  The  fall  in  oil  prices  has  supported  household  purchasing  power  as  well.  Simple 
calculations suggest that the average household has gained some $1,300 in purchasing power 
since mid-2014 from the fall in gasoline prices.7 With continuing gains in disposable income 
and wealth, I expect consumer spending to grow at a solid rate. I also expect the housing 
sector  to  make  further  progress.  Both  home  sales  and  construction  have  been  gradually 
improving, and residential investment made a noticeable contribution to GDP growth over the 
past year. Housing has been supported by low mortgage rates, and while mortgage credit is 
still difficult to obtain for households with low credit scores or hard-to-document income, those 
with good credit histories are generally able to borrow at very favorable terms.8 And fiscal policy 
at the combined national, state, and local levels, which subtracted from GDP growth for much 
of recovery, is now a small positive. 
Economists often say, “on the other hand.” So, in keeping with that tradition, I’ll now turn to the 
less-positive.  Economic  developments  abroad  have  significantly  restrained  growth  in  the 
United States over the past year, although I am cautiously optimistic that these headwinds are 
now  fading.  Concerns  about  slowing  growth  in  China  and  falling  commodity  prices,  which 
afflicted global financial markets early this year and thus likely weighed on demand, appear to 
have eased somewhat. Indicators suggest that foreign economies are growing, if still at only a 
moderate pace, and foreign financial markets have recovered and stabilized. That said, net 
exports have been a drag on U.S. GDP growth over the past year and are likely to continue to 
weigh on growth over the medium term. This drag, in part, reflects the prolonged effects of the 
significant increase in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the middle of 2014, a 
development  that  has  been  particularly  challenging for  U.S. manufacturers  and  other firms 
competing with foreign producers. 
Although lower oil prices have likely been a positive influence on the U.S. economy overall, 
they also have had a negative side, given the sizable U.S. energy industry. New drilling and 
energy-sector  employment  have  plunged,  and  the  effects  have  spilled  over  to  businesses 
serving the energy production sector. But the largest declines in drilling activity are likely now 
behind us, and with oil prices having recovered somewhat, I expect that oil prices will become 
less of a factor. 
Business investment has been weak in the past six months or so, even beyond the energy 
sector, and investment in capital equipment is reported to have declined in the last quarter of 
2015  and  first  quarter  of  this  year.  I  suspect  there  is  a  transitory  element  to  this  weak 
BIS central bankers’ speeches

   investment performance, and I expect investment to rebound. But the latest labor market data 
raise  the  less  favorable  possibility  that  firms  may  instead  have  decided  to  expand  their 
operations more slowly, and I intend to continue to pay close attention to developments in this 
area. 
As  I  said,  the  positive  economic  forces  have  outweighed  the  negative,  and  despite  the 
challenges that the economy continues to face, I continue to expect further progress toward 
our employment and inflation objectives. 
Some important uncertainties 
To be sure, there is considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook that I have been 
discussing, and, as I have already noted, we should expect to be surprised in the future just 
as we have been surprised in the past. Four areas of uncertainty seem particularly salient at 
present. 
The  first  involves  the  thrust  and  resilience  of  domestic  demand.  The  U.S.  economy  has 
performed better than many others around the globe, and that performance has relied chiefly 
on  the  resilience  of  domestic  sources  of  demand,  consumer  spending  in  particular.  So  an 
important question is whether the U.S. economy could continue to make progress amid fairly 
considerable global bumpiness. I continue to think that the answer to that question is yes, but 
the weak investment performance in recent months is concerning, and Friday’s employment 
report provides another reminder that the question is still relevant. 
The second uncertainty pertains to the economic situation abroad. Even though the financial 
stresses  that  had  emanated  from  abroad  at  the  start  of  this  year  have  eased,  global  risks 
require continued attention. Much of the turmoil early this year appeared to be associated with 
concern  over  the  outlook  for  Chinese  growth,  which  in  turn  has  broad  implications  for 
commodity prices and global economic growth. Recently, the renminbi has moved in a more 
predictable  fashion  and  Chinese  capital  outflows  have  abated.  However,  it  is  widely 
acknowledged  that  China  faces  considerable  challenges  as  it  continues  to  rebalance  its 
economy toward domestic demand and consumption. 
More generally, in the current environment of sluggish growth, low inflation, and already very 
accommodative monetary policy in many advanced economies, investor perceptions of and 
appetite for risk can change abruptly. One development that could shift investor sentiment is 
the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A U.K. vote to exit the European Union could 
have significant economic repercussions. 
A third key uncertainty for the U.S. economy is the outlook for productivity growth – that is, 
increases  in  the  amount  of  output  produced  per  hour  worked.  While  the  job  market  has 
strengthened  significantly,  GDP  increases  have been  less  impressive. That combination of 
solid  labor market gains  and  moderate GDP growth  reflects the fact  that  labor  productivity 
growth has been unusually weak in recent years, averaging less than 1/2 percent per year 
since 2010.9 
Over  time,  productivity  growth  is  the  key  determinant  of  improvements  in  living  standards, 
supporting  higher  pay  for  workers  without  increased  costs  for  employers.  Recent  weak 
productivity growth likely helps account for the disappointing pace of wage gains during this 
economic  expansion.  Therefore,  understanding  whether,  and  by  how  much,  productivity 
growth will pick up is a crucial part of the economic outlook. But this is a very difficult question, 
and economists are divided. Some are relatively optimistic, pointing to the ongoing pace of 
innovations  that  promise  revolutionary  technologies,  from  genetically  tailored  medical 
therapies to self-driving cars. Others believe that the low-hanging fruit of innovation largely has 
been picked and that there is simply less scope for further gains.10 
My position has been, and remains, cautiously optimistic. There is some evidence that the 
deep recession had a long-lasting effect in depressing investment, research and development 
spending,  and  the  start-up  of  new  firms,  and  that  these  factors  have,  in  turn,  lowered 
4 
 BIS central bankers’ speeches 
   productivity growth. With time, I expect this effect to ease in a stronger economy.11 I also see 
no  obvious  slowdown  in  the  pace  or  the  potential  benefits  of  innovation  in  America,  which 
likewise may bear fruit more readily in a stronger economy. In the meantime, it would be helpful 
to adopt public policies designed to boost productivity. Strengthening education and promoting 
innovation and investment, public and private, will support longer-term growth in productivity 
and greater gains in living standards. 
A fourth important uncertainty for the economic outlook involves how quickly inflation will move 
back to 2 percent. As long as oil prices do not resume their earlier declines and the dollar does 
not rise substantially further, my expectation is that inflation will move up to 2 percent over the 
next one to two years. But oil prices and the dollar can move unpredictably. In addition, a 
further strengthening of labor market conditions would typically be estimated to exert modest 
upward pressure on inflation over the next couple of years; but such estimates are inherently 
imprecise, and the effect on inflation could turn out to be significantly different, either upward 
or downward, than I expect. 
Uncertainty  concerning  the  outlook  for  inflation  also  reflects,  in  part,  uncertainty  about  the 
behavior of those inflation expectations that are relevant to price setting. For two decades, 
inflation has been relatively stable, reacting less persistently than before to temporary factors 
like a recession or a swing in oil prices. The most convincing explanation for this stability, in 
my view, is that longer-term inflation expectations have remained quite stable.12 So it bears 
noting that some survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved a little 
lower over the past couple of years, while proxies for these expectations inferred from financial 
market instruments like inflation-protected securities have moved down more noticeably. It is 
unclear whether these indicators point to a true decline in those inflation expectations that are 
relevant for price setting; for example, the financial market measures may reflect changing 
attitudes toward inflation risk more than actual inflation expectations. But the indicators have 
moved enough to get my close attention. If inflation expectations really are moving lower, that 
could call into question whether inflation will move back to 2 percent as quickly as I expect. 
Policy implications 
Let  me  now  turn  to  the  implications  of  the  economic  outlook,  as  well  as  the  uncertainties 
associated with that outlook, for monetary policy. My overall assessment is that the current 
stance of monetary policy is generally appropriate, in that it is providing support to the economy 
by encouraging further labor market improvement that will help return inflation to 2 percent. At 
the same time, I continue to think that the federal funds rate will probably need to rise gradually 
over time to ensure price stability and maximum sustainable employment in the longer run. 
Several considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, the current stance of monetary policy 
is stimulative, although perhaps not as stimulative as might appear at first glance. One useful 
measure of the stance of policy is the deviation of the federal funds rate from a “neutral” value, 
defined  as  the  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  that  would  be  neither  expansionary  nor 
contractionary if the economy was operating near potential. This neutral rate changes over 
time, and, at any given date, it depends on a constellation of underlying forces affecting the 
economy.  At  present,  many  estimates  show  the  neutral  rate  to  be  quite  low  by  historical 
standards – indeed, close to zero when measured in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms.13 The 
current  actual  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate,  also  measured  in  real  terms,  is  even  lower, 
somewhere around minus 1 percent. With the actual real federal funds rate modestly below 
the relatively low neutral real rate, the stance of monetary policy at present should be viewed 
as modestly accommodative.14  
Although the economy is now fairly close to the FOMC’s goal of maximum employment, I view 
our modestly accommodative stance of policy as appropriate for several reasons. First, with 
inflation continuing to run below our objective, a mild undershooting of the unemployment rate 
considered to be normal in the longer run could help move inflation back up to 2 percent more 
quickly. Second, a stronger job market could also support labor market improvement along 
BIS central bankers’ speeches 
 5 
   other dimensions, including greater labor force participation. A third reason relates to the risks 
associated with the constraint on conventional monetary policy when the federal funds rate is 
near  zero.  If  inflation  were  to  move  persistently  above  2 percent  or  the  economy  were  to 
become notably overheated, the Committee could readily increase the target range for the 
federal funds rate. However, if inflation were to remain persistently low or the expansion were 
to  falter,  the  FOMC  would  be  able  to  provide  only  a  limited  amount  of  additional  stimulus 
through conventional means.15  
These motivations notwithstanding, I continue to believe that it will be appropriate to gradually 
reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided that labor market conditions 
strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress toward our 2 percent objective. 
Because  monetary  policy  affects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  steps  to  withdraw  this  monetary 
accommodation ought to be initiated before the FOMC’s goals are fully reached. And if the 
headwinds that have lingered since the crisis slowly abate as I anticipate, this would mean that 
the neutral rate of interest itself will move up, providing further impetus to gradually increase 
the federal funds rate. But I stress that the economic outlook, including the pace at which the 
neutral rate may shift over time, is uncertain, so monetary policy cannot proceed on any preset 
path.16  
This point is well illustrated by events so far this year. For a time in January and early February, 
financial  markets  here  and  abroad  became  turbulent  and  financial  conditions  tightened, 
reflecting and reinforcing concerns about downside risks to the global economy. In addition, 
data received during the winter suggested that U.S. growth had weakened even as progress 
in the labor market remained solid. Because the implications of these developments for the 
economic outlook were unclear, the FOMC decided at its January, March, and April meetings 
that it would be prudent to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. 
Over the past few months, financial conditions have recovered significantly and many of the 
risks  from  abroad  have  diminished,  although  some  risks  remain.  In  addition,  consumer 
spending appears to have rebounded, providing some reassurance that overall growth has 
indeed  picked  up  as  expected.  Unfortunately,  as  I  noted  earlier,  new  questions  about  the 
economic outlook have been raised by the recent labor market data. Is the markedly reduced 
pace of hiring in April and May a harbinger of a persistent slowdown in the broader economy? 
Or will monthly payroll gains move up toward the solid pace they maintained earlier this year 
and in 2015? Does the latest reading on the unemployment rate indicate that we are essentially 
back  to  full  employment,  or  does  relatively  subdued  wage  growth  signal  that  more  slack 
remains? My colleagues and I will be wrestling with these and other related questions going 
forward. 
Conclusion 
To summarize, I have explained why I expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve and 
why I expect that further gradual increases in the federal funds rate will probably be appropriate 
to best promote the FOMC’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. I have also 
laid out the considerable and unavoidable uncertainties that apply to both this outlook for the 
economy and to the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. My colleagues and I will make 
our policy decisions based on what incoming information implies for the economic outlook and 
the risks to that outlook. What is certain is that monetary policy is not on a preset course, and 
that the Committee will respond to new data and reassess risks so as to best achieve our 
goals.

several years. In addition, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s “wage growth 
tracker,” wage gains for continuously employed full-time workers have been gradually trending 
higher in recent years and were 3-1/2 percent over the 12 months through April. However, the 
employment cost index, another broad measure of labor compensation costs, has remained 
quite soft, rising only 1-3/4 percent over the year ended in March. Return to text

5 The notion that inflation can be too low sounds strange to many people, but very low inflation 
typically means very low nominal interest rates, leaving little room for monetary policy to push 
rates  down  to  offset  adverse  shocks  to  the  economy,  thereby  increasing  the  chances  that 
recessions and the associated job losses would be more severe and persistent. In addition, 
persistent  and  unexpectedly  low  inflation  may  significantly  raise  the  real  cost  of  making 
mortgage and other loan payments if accompanied by (as is typically the case) smaller-than-
anticipated nominal income gains. Return to text

8 Housing  could  receive  another  boost  if there  were  a  continued revival  in  the  rate  of  new 
household formation, which has been depressed since the recession as young adults have 
delayed moving out of their parents’ homes. Return to text 
9The figures measure output per hour worked in the business sector. From 2007:Q4 through 
2016:Q1, productivity growth averaged about 1 percent per year. By comparison, business-
sector productivity growth averaged 1-1/2 percent per year over the two decades from the mid-
1970s to the mid-1990s, and then it averaged 2-3/4 percent per year over the next dozen years 
until the latest recession began. Return to text 
10 On the relatively optimistic side, see Mokyr (2014) or Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014). For 
a less optimistic perspective, see Gordon (2016) or Cowen (2011). Similarly, Fernald (2014) 
dates the most recent slowdown in measured productivity growth to before the great recession, 
in 2005. For evidence that the recent slowdown cannot be fully explained by measurement 
difficulties, see Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016). Return to text

13 The neutral rate is not directly observable and must instead be inferred from economic data, 
and estimates will vary depending on the methodology employed. However, we know that the 
neutral rate must have been well below its historical norm in recent years, because with the 
actual real interest having been as low as it has been lately, the economy would have otherwise 
expanded much more than has been the case. In recent years, the neutral rate has likely been 
held down below normal levels because of the factors I discussed earlier, including persistently 
weak growth abroad, the high exchange value of the dollar, low rates of household formation, 
and weak productivity growth. As I have noted before (see Yellen, 2015b), there is empirical 
evidence to support the conclusion that the neutral rate is currently not far from zero. See, in 
particular,  Lubik  and  Matthes  (2015),  Laubach  and  Williams  (2016),  and  Johanssen  and 
Mertens (2016). Return to text 
14 The targeted federal funds rate, currently 0.37 percent, less the 12-month core inflation rate 
for  personal  consumption  expenditures  through  April,  equals  about  negative  1.2  percent.

15 There are unconventional policy tools that could be employed to provide further support to 
aggregate demand, if necessary, and the efficacy and costs of using those tools would be 
weighed  by  the  FOMC,  as  appropriate.  However,  so  long  as  these  tools  are  considered

the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates represents a source of asymmetric risk

16 Uncertainty about where the target range for the federal funds rate will be in the long run 
provides another reason why increases in policy rates cannot be on a preset path. I view the 
median value of 3-1/4 percent from the March SEP as being a reasonable guess for the longer-
run normal rate. But FOMC participants have lowered their estimates of the longer-run normal 
rate over time, and as new evidence comes in and we see how economic conditions evolve, 
further changes, in either direction, are likely. Return to text
